Short sessions and supersets helped the schedule. I noticed promising changes in joint comfort. Given my goal, I tried to push progressive overload and protein timing. Average sleep was ~7.0 h; training quality tracked well with meal timing and hydration.",Add a 20–30 g protein snack post-workout and a slow-digesting protein near bedtime. Insert a 10–15 min mobility block on rest days to keep joints happy. Aim for a consistent lights-out routine to push sleep toward 7–8 h. Keep meals simple; adjust seasoning and veggies for variety. Keep recipes under 5 steps; reuse the same spice mix to reduce friction. Do a quick 5-min walk after larger meals.
