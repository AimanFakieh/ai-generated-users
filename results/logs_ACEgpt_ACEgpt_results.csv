P01,2025-W46,15.6,28.15,65.9,2650,6.9,"First week on this plan and honestly it's been pretty solid! The shakshouka breakfast is way better than I expected - never really cooked with tomato sauce for breakfast before but it's filling and tasty. The kabsa is my favorite meal, reminds me of home cooking. I struggled a bit with the jareesh at first since I'm not the best cook, but by day 4 I got the hang of it. The workouts are tough though - those advanced routines are no joke for someone at my level. My legs were absolutely destroyed after the first leg day, could barely walk the next day. Had to skip one upper body session on Thursday because I was too sore and didn't sleep well Wednesday night. The labneh and dates combo is surprisingly good for a snack, keeps me going between meals. I'm eating most of what's planned but sometimes can't finish all the jareesh in meal 4, probably hitting around 2600 kcal most days instead of the full 2800. Feeling stronger already though, and the soreness is getting a bit better. Sleep has been okay, averaging around my usual 7 hours but had a couple nights where I only got 6 because of work stress."
P01,2025-W47,15.4,28.35,66.4,2343,6.84,"Week 2 of my muscle gain journey (W47) was definitely challenging but I can see small improvements from last week. Started at 65.9kg and I'm happy to report I'm seeing some gains!

Monday kicked off with W25 (full body strength) - the compound movements are still tough but I'm getting better at form. Hit about 85% of my calorie target (2070 kcal) because I underestimated portion sizes for my chicken and rice meal. Still learning to eyeball portions as a beginner cook.

Tuesday was a rest day and I actually nailed my nutrition - 2450 kcal. Meal prepped some basic chicken breasts and rice which saved me time. Sleep was rough though, only got 6.5 hours due to work stress.

Wednesday's W21 workout (upper body focus) felt brutal on my chest and shoulders. Definitely experienced DOMS from Monday still lingering. Managed about 2380 kcal. My budget of 40 SAR/day is workable but I'm buying in bulk - eggs, chicken, rice, and budget protein powder are my staples.

Thursday I was supposed to rest but felt sluggish all day. Only hit 2200 kcal because I skipped my evening snack - just wasn't hungry and sleep deprivation caught up with me (6.2 hours). This is where my 75% adherence shows.

Friday's W25 session was better than Monday! I could feel slight strength improvements, especially on squats. Got 2500 kcal in, slightly over target but needed it for recovery. Sleep improved to 7.1 hours.

Saturday's W21 workout almost didn't happen - I was tempted to skip due to fatigue but pushed through at 70% intensity. Hit 2380 kcal. My cooking is definitely improving; made a decent stir-fry without burning anything!

Sunday rest day, focused on recovery. Ate 2420 kcal, meal prepped for next week, and got 7.5 hours of sleep finally.

Overall: The workouts are intense for my beginner level - some exercises I had to reduce weight or modify. DOMS in legs and chest was real, especially days 2-4. My adherence was about 75% as expected - hit 3.5 out of 4 workouts at full intensity, and nutrition was 85-95% of target most days. Budget held up fine with smart shopping. The 6.9 hour average sleep is my biggest barrier; I need to prioritize rest more for muscle recovery.

Physically, I feel slightly fuller in my chest and arms, though it might be pump and water retention. Energy levels varied - high after good sleep, dragging after poor sleep. No injuries, just normal beginner soreness. Looking forward to week 3 with better sleep habits!"
P01,2025-W48,15.3,28.5,66.7,2380,6.7,"Week 48 is complete! Overall, I'd say this was a solid week with some real-world challenges that tested my commitment. Started Monday strong with W25 (Upper Body Push) - the bench press variations and overhead work really challenged me, especially since I'm still at beginner level. Tuesday's W21 (Lower Body Pull) had me feeling those deadlifts and hamstring curls for days afterward. The DOMS was real, but I managed it with extra stretching and made sure to hit my protein targets.

Mid-week got tricky. Wednesday I had a late work commitment that pushed my sleep to only 6 hours, which affected my Thursday W25 session - I completed it but had to drop the weight on my last few sets. Friday's W21 went better after catching up on sleep. The weekend was crucial for recovery.

Nutrition-wise, I'm getting better at meal prep. Bulk-bought chicken breast, rice, and oats at the start of the week which kept me under budget. My cooking is improving - only burned one batch of rice this week (progress!). I averaged around 2380 kcal daily, slightly under my 2430 target, mainly because Thursday I was too tired to eat my evening snack. Protein intake was consistent at ~150g/day thanks to my whey protein stash.

Sleep averaged 6.7 hours this week - a bit below my usual 6.84. Tuesday and Wednesday nights were rough due to work stress and some lingering muscle soreness. I'm learning that recovery is just as important as the workouts themselves.

Missed zero workouts completely, which I'm proud of, though that Thursday session was definitely at 80% intensity. My 75% adherence propensity was tested but I pushed through. Budget held at around 38 SAR/day - the bulk buying strategy is working well.

Physically, I feel slightly fuller in my chest and shoulders, and my lifts are incrementally improving. The scale shows a small uptick which is expected with muscle gain goals. Energy levels are decent despite the sleep debt. Looking forward to next week and maintaining this momentum!"
P01,2025-W49,15.2,28.7,67.2,2455,6.7,"Week 49 complete! Started strong with good energy on Days 1-2, hitting both W25 workouts at full intensity. The higher calorie target (2508 kcal) was challenging to meet consistently on my 40 SAR budget, but I managed by buying bulk rice, chicken thighs, and eggs. Day 3's W25 session felt harder - probably the accumulated fatigue from two heavy sessions plus only 6.5 hours sleep. Had to reduce weight by about 10% on the last two compound movements.

Day 4's W21 workout went better than expected despite lingering soreness. My beginner cooking skills are improving - meal prepping Sunday helped a lot. Made a big batch of chicken and rice that lasted three days. Days 5-7 were rest days which I used to catch up on sleep (averaged 7.2 hours those nights vs 6.3 on training days).

Budget-wise, I spent 38.5 SAR/day average. Skipped some of the more expensive protein sources and relied heavily on eggs and canned tuna. Fiber intake was lower than target most days (averaged 21g vs 25g target). Noticed I'm getting hungrier between meals now - probably the muscle-building process kicking in.

DOMS in quads and chest was significant Days 2-4 but manageable. No injuries. The 75% adherence propensity played out - I hit about 85% this week when accounting for the reduced intensity session. Sleep deficit is still my biggest barrier; 6.7 hours isn't quite enough for optimal recovery. Felt it especially mid-week.

Positives: All 4 scheduled workouts completed, nutrition within 5% of target on 5/7 days, no missed sessions. Weight up slightly which is expected on a muscle gain protocol. Strength feeling better on the W25 compound lifts - added 2.5kg to my squat working weight.

Areas to improve: Need to find ways to get 7+ hours sleep consistently, increase fiber intake (maybe add oats to breakfast), and better pre-workout nutrition timing on early morning sessions."
P01,2025-W50,15.1,28.9,67.6,2480,6.6,"Week 50 was a solid continuation of my muscle gain journey, though I'm definitely feeling the cumulative fatigue from consecutive training blocks. Managed to hit all 4 scheduled workouts (W25, W21, W25, W21) but had to dial back intensity on the second W25 session to about 85% due to persistent sleep debt and lingering DOMS from earlier in the week.

Nutrition-wise, I averaged around 2480 kcal/day, which is slightly under my 2501 target but still in the ballpark. Protein intake was decent at about 154g daily - just shy of the 156g goal but close enough given my budget constraints. I'm getting better at meal prep, though I did have to improvise on Day 5 when I ran out of chicken and substituted with eggs and canned tuna to stay within my 40 SAR/day budget. Ended up averaging 38.8 SAR/day, so budget discipline is improving.

The workouts themselves felt challenging but manageable. W25 sessions (which I assume are higher volume or intensity) definitely took more out of me than W21. By the second W25 workout on Day 5, my legs were still recovering from Day 3, and I could feel my form starting to slip on squats, so I reduced the weight by about 10% to maintain safety. No injuries, which is the priority.

Sleep remains my biggest obstacle - averaged 6.6 hours this week with a rough night on Day 4 where I only got 5.8 hours due to work stress. I can directly correlate my energy levels and workout performance to sleep quality. When I managed 7+ hours (Days 1 and 6), I felt significantly stronger and more focused during training.

DOMS was moderate to heavy, especially in quads, glutes, and chest throughout the week. I'm noticing I recover a bit slower than I'd like, which again points back to the sleep issue. Started incorporating more stretching and foam rolling on rest days, which seems to help.

Weight-wise, I'm seeing gradual increases which is encouraging. The scale showed a net gain of about 0.4 kg over the week, and I feel like it's mostly quality mass based on how my clothes fit and visual changes in the mirror. Strength is slowly trending up too - added 2.5 kg to my bench press working sets.

Overall adherence was around 80% when I factor in the intensity reduction and slight calorie deficit. Not perfect, but realistic given my current life circumstances. The key wins were: no missed workouts, no injuries, stayed within budget, and continued making measurable progress. The main area for improvement remains sleep - if I can push that average up to 7.5 hours, I think I'd see even better results."
P01,2025-W51,14.9,29.2,68,2450,6.5,"Week 51 was a solid continuation of my muscle gain journey, though I definitely felt the cumulative fatigue building up. Completed all 4 scheduled workouts (W25, W21, W25, W21) but had to dial back intensity on the second W25 session again - probably around 80% this time because my legs were still screaming from the first one. The DOMS was real, especially in quads and glutes for days 2-5. Sleep remained inconsistent, averaging around 6.5 hours, with one particularly rough night (5.5h) after a late study session that made the Thursday workout feel like moving through mud.

Nutrition-wise, I stayed pretty close to target at about 2450 kcal daily, hitting roughly 152g protein on average. Budget came in at 39.2 SAR/day, so well within limits. I'm getting better at meal prep - made a big batch of chicken thighs with rice and veggies that lasted 3 days, and relied heavily on eggs and canned tuna for quick protein hits. One day I was short on time and grabbed a shawarma wrap (15 SAR) which pushed me slightly over on fats but kept me sane.

The mirror is showing subtle changes - chest and shoulders look a bit fuller, and I'm noticing more definition in my arms even though I'm eating in a surplus. Strength gains continue: added another 2.5kg to my bench press mid-week and my squat form feels more stable. Energy levels were up and down - great on days with 7+ hours sleep, pretty sluggish on the low-sleep days. Added more stretching and foam rolling on rest days which seems to help with recovery.

One challenge this week was fighting the urge to skip the second leg day (W25) because of lingering soreness, but I pushed through at reduced intensity and felt good about maintaining consistency. Overall adherence around 78-80% when accounting for intensity modifications. No injuries, no major setbacks. Feeling optimistic about continuing this trajectory into next week."
P01,2025-W52,14.7,29.4,68.4,2406,6.4,"Week 52 was a mixed bag - started strong but hit some walls mid-week. Completed all 4 scheduled workouts (W25, W21, W25, W21) though the second W25 session on Day 5 was rough, probably running at 75% intensity because my legs were absolutely trashed from the previous sessions. Sleep was all over the place - had two nights under 6 hours which really messed with my recovery and focus. The worst was Day 4 when I only got 5.3 hours and felt like a zombie the next day during my workout.

Nutrition-wise, I hit about 97% of my calorie target (averaging 2406 kcal/day vs 2480 target). Protein was decent at 151g/day average, just shy of the 156g goal. The budget held up well at 39.4 SAR/day - I meal prepped most of the week but grabbed a chicken shawarma plate on Day 4 when I was too tired to cook after that bad sleep night. Cost me about 25 SAR but honestly saved my sanity.

DOMS was intense Days 2-6, especially quads and glutes. The W25 workouts really destroy my lower body. I kept up with foam rolling every rest day which helped a bit, but walking up stairs was still painful. Energy levels were directly tied to sleep - good nights (7+ hours) meant solid gym sessions, bad nights meant grinding through sets.

Strength gains continue: added 2.5kg to bench press again, and my squat form feels more stable even though the weight is challenging. Noticing more definition in chest and shoulders, arms looking fuller. No injuries or form breakdowns, just managing fatigue.

The adherence propensity of 0.75 feels accurate - I'm committed but not perfect. The reduced intensity on that one W25 session and the single convenience meal reflect real-world constraints. Overall, maybe 76-78% adherence this week when accounting for sleep issues and intensity drops."
P01,2026-W01,14.5,29.6,68.7,2450,6.3,"Week 1 of 2026 was a solid start to the year, though I definitely felt the carryover fatigue from last week's training. The DOMS from those W25 sessions lingered through the first half of the week, making the Monday workout pretty challenging. I managed to push through all four scheduled sessions (W25, W21, W25, W21), but had to dial back intensity on the Thursday W25 workout to about 70% because I only got 5.5 hours of sleep Wednesday night and my legs were still heavy.

Sleep was all over the place again - ranged from 5.5 to 7.4 hours. The nights I got under 6 hours really showed up in my energy levels and workout performance. I'm noticing a clear pattern now: bad sleep = worse recovery = harder workouts. Need to prioritize getting to bed earlier, but work and social stuff keeps getting in the way.

Nutrition was pretty good overall. Hit around 2450 calories daily on average (slightly under the 2517 target but close enough). Protein averaged about 153g/day which is 97% of target - happy with that consistency. I meal prepped on Sunday which helped a lot, but by Friday I was tired of eating the same chicken and rice, so I grabbed a shawarma wrap (20 SAR) on the way home. Not ideal but kept it reasonable.

Budget stayed tight at about 39.2 SAR/day. The shawarma splurge put me slightly over one day but I balanced it with simpler meals over the weekend. Eggs, tuna, rice, and chicken breast continue to be my staples. Found a good deal on frozen vegetables which helped add variety without breaking the bank.

The workouts themselves felt productive when I had energy. W25 sessions are brutal on the legs - squats and lunges really tax me. W21 upper body days felt better, and I'm seeing continued progress on bench press (added another 2.5kg for reps). Arms and chest are definitely looking fuller. A couple friends commented that I'm looking bigger which was motivating.

Recovery-wise, I kept up with foam rolling on rest days (Tuesday, Thursday evening, Saturday). It helps with the soreness but doesn't eliminate it. I'm learning to distinguish between good muscle fatigue and potential injury warning signs - everything feels like normal DOMS, no sharp pains.

Challenges this week: sleep inconsistency, some mental fatigue from work stress, and fighting the urge to skip workouts when tired. The 75% adherence propensity is real - there were definitely moments I considered sleeping in instead of hitting the gym, especially on that rough Thursday morning. But I showed up, even if I had to reduce the weight.

Positives: consistency with four workouts completed, decent nutrition adherence, staying within budget, visible physique changes continuing, no injuries. I'm building good habits even when motivation dips.

Looking ahead: need to focus on sleep hygiene - setting a firm bedtime, reducing screen time before bed. Also want to prep some different protein sources to avoid meal fatigue. Overall, this felt like a 74-76% adherence week considering the intensity reduction and sleep issues, but I'm proud I didn't skip any sessions entirely."
P01,2026-W02,14.4,29.8,69.1,2590,6.4,"Week 2 (2026-W02) was a mixed bag. Started strong with good energy Monday and Tuesday, hitting all lifts with solid form. Wednesday's sleep was rough again (5.8h) which carried into Thursday's workout - had to drop the weight on squats by 5kg to finish safely. Friday I was dragging hard, considered skipping but pushed through at about 75% intensity. The weekend gave me a chance to catch up on sleep which helped a lot.

Nutrition-wise, I'm getting better at meal prep but had another convenience moment on Day 6 when I was too tired to cook - grabbed a chicken shawarma plate for 25 SAR. The increased calorie target (2668 vs 2517 last week) is challenging my budget. I'm averaging about 41 SAR/day which is slightly over my 40 SAR limit, mainly because protein sources are expensive here. Had to buy an extra pack of chicken breasts mid-week.

DOMS was intense after Monday's chest/triceps session - couldn't straighten my arms fully until Wednesday. Foam rolling helped but I need to be more consistent with it. My bench press is progressing nicely though - added another 2.5kg and hit 8 reps on the third set which felt amazing.

The biggest win this week was seeing the scale move up slightly (0.4kg) while keeping fat percentage stable. My shirts are fitting tighter around the chest and shoulders which is motivating. A coworker asked if I've been working out which was a nice confidence boost.

Challenges: Sleep is still my Achilles heel. Work stress isn't letting up and I'm doom-scrolling on my phone before bed. Need to fix this. Also, eating 2668 calories consistently is harder than I thought - I'm full most of the time and forcing down the last meal. Budget is tight and I might need to find cheaper protein sources or reduce portion sizes slightly.

Overall adherence felt like 73-74% this week. Completed all 4 workouts but two were at reduced intensity. Calories averaged 2590 (97.1% of target). Protein was good at 162g/day. Sleep averaged 6.4h which is marginally better than last week but still not ideal."
P01,2026-W03,14.3,30.1,69.8,2511,6.3,"Week 3 was a real grind. Started strong on Monday with good energy after decent weekend sleep, but the same sleep issues that plagued Week 2 came back hard. Tuesday night I only got 5.5 hours because of work stress and couldn't shut my brain off. That destroyed Wednesday's workout - I had to drop the weight on overhead press by 5kg just to complete the sets safely. Thursday was better sleep-wise (7.2h) so I bounced back, but then Friday night was another disaster at 5.9 hours.

The 2610 calorie target is still challenging. I'm eating until I'm uncomfortably full most days, and honestly, I'm getting tired of the same meals. I tried to save money by meal prepping more aggressively this week, but by Day 5 I was so sick of the chicken and rice that I grabbed a shawarma wrap (20 SAR) just to have something different. Budget was tight again - came in at 40.8 SAR/day average.

Workouts: Completed all 4 scheduled sessions (W25 Monday/Wednesday, W21 Tuesday/Thursday) but Wednesday was definitely at reduced intensity (~70%). The other three were solid though. I'm seeing strength gains - added 2.5kg to my squat and managed 9 reps on the last set of Romanian deadlifts Thursday, which felt great. DOMS was manageable this week, probably because my body is adapting.

The weight gain is happening but slower than expected - only +0.3kg this week. Not sure if I'm actually hitting my calorie target consistently or if my activity level outside the gym is higher than I think. I do walk a lot at work. My chest and shoulders are definitely looking fuller though, which is motivating.

Sleep is the biggest barrier right now. Six nights under 7 hours, with two absolutely brutal nights under 6 hours. I need to fix this - maybe leave my phone outside the bedroom? The fatigue is cumulative and by Saturday I was absolutely wrecked. Skipped foam rolling 3 days this week because I just wanted to collapse into bed.

Mental state: Motivation is wavering. The monotony of meal prep, the constant tiredness, the budget stress - it's all adding up. I'm committed to the goal but I need to find ways to make this more sustainable. Maybe I need to accept slightly slower gains with a more manageable calorie target? Or find cheaper protein sources? Something needs to adjust because I can feel burnout creeping in."
P01,2026-W04,14.4,30.2,70.2,2493,6.4,"Week 4 was rough - I hit a wall mid-week. Started strong on Monday with good energy, crushed the push workout and actually enjoyed the variety in meals (finally!). Tuesday's pull session felt solid too, though I noticed my grip failing before my back on lat pulldowns. Wednesday night was a disaster - only got 5.2 hours of sleep because of work deadline stress, and it completely wrecked Thursday's workout. I had to skip the gym entirely on Thursday because I felt like a zombie at work and just couldn't muster the energy. That's the first missed workout in a month and it really got in my head.

Friday I dragged myself back for the push workout but had to drop weights by 10-15% across the board. My chest press felt weak and my shoulders were fatigued before I even started. Saturday's pull session was better - got 7.1 hours sleep Friday night which helped a lot. The extra sleep made such a difference in how the weights moved.

Food-wise, the new meal variety helped a lot with adherence. The chicken curry and beef stir-fry rotation kept me from getting that meal prep fatigue. But I still ended up getting fast food twice - once on Thursday when I was too tired to prep, and once on Sunday when I just wanted something different. Budget went over again (43.2 SAR/day average) which is stressing me out.

The missed Thursday workout is really bothering me. I know one session won't kill my progress, but combined with the reduced intensity Friday, I feel like I lost momentum. My weight is up slightly which is good, but I can't tell if it's muscle or just water/fat from the inconsistent week. Sleep is still my biggest enemy - averaged 6.4 hours but the variance is killing me. When I get under 6 hours, everything falls apart.

Mentally, I'm questioning if I can sustain this. The constant battle with sleep, budget stress, and now missing workouts... it feels like I'm fighting uphill. I need to figure out the sleep thing or this bulk is going to stall out. On the positive side, when I DO get good sleep, the workouts feel great and I can see changes in the mirror. My shoulders are definitely bigger and my chest has more definition. I just need consistency."
P01,2026-W05,14.7,30.4,71.1,2421,6.3,"Week 5 was a critical turning point - I hit a wall mid-week and seriously questioned whether I can sustain this. Started strong Monday and Tuesday with good workouts, but Wednesday night I only got 5.8 hours of sleep due to work stress and doom-scrolling on my phone again. Thursday's workout felt like dragging myself through mud - completed it but at maybe 80% intensity, and I could barely focus on form. The fatigue was crushing. Friday I actually missed my scheduled workout entirely. I woke up exhausted, had an early work meeting I'd forgotten about, and by evening I just couldn't muster the energy. That's two missed workouts in two weeks now, and it's really getting to me mentally. I feel like I'm failing.

The weekend was slightly better - I forced myself to do Saturday's workout and it went okay, maybe 90% intensity. Sunday was a rest day which I desperately needed. My sleep averaged around 6.3 hours this week with huge swings - one night I got 7.2 hours and felt human again, but most nights were 5.5-6.5 hours. I can feel the sleep debt piling up like a weight on my chest.

Nutrition was a disaster. I hit my targets Monday and Tuesday, but by Wednesday I was too tired to meal prep properly. Thursday I grabbed fast food twice - a shawarma wrap for lunch (25 SAR) and chicken nuggets for dinner (18 SAR) because I had zero energy to cook. Friday I ordered a pizza (32 SAR) which completely blew my budget. Over the weekend I tried to get back on track with my usual rice and chicken, but I'm so sick of eating the same thing. Sunday I made scrambled eggs and toast because I couldn't face another chicken breast. My daily average was probably around 2420 calories, and I'm estimating I spent about 47 SAR per day this week - way over budget.

Physically, I'm seeing some changes - my shoulders look a bit fuller and my arms have more definition - but I'm also noticing some softness around my midsection that wasn't there before. Could be water retention from poor sleep and high sodium takeout, or maybe I'm gaining fat along with muscle. The scale went up 0.5kg but I don't feel good about it.

DOMS was moderate after Monday's workout, then minimal because I wasn't pushing hard enough or missing sessions. I foam rolled twice this week, both times half-heartedly. My motivation is at an all-time low. I keep thinking about how much easier life was before I started this, even though I know I was unhappy with how I looked. The mental fatigue is worse than the physical fatigue. I'm burned out and it's only been 5 weeks.

The positive: I didn't quit entirely. I still did 3 out of 4 workouts, even if they weren't great. I'm learning that I need to fix my sleep or nothing else will work. I'm also realizing my meal variety is too limited and my cooking skills are holding me back. I need simpler meal prep strategies and maybe some ready-made protein options that fit my budget. But honestly, right now I'm just trying to survive each day and not give up completely."
P01,2026-W06,15.2,30.3,71.5,2270,6,"Week 6 was a breaking point. I went into this week already burned out from missing two workouts in the previous weeks, sleep-deprived, and financially stressed from budget overages. The pattern continued and actually worsened. I completed only 2 out of 4 scheduled workouts (50% completion rate) - my worst week yet. Monday's W25 session felt impossible after a 5.8-hour night, so I skipped it entirely. Tuesday I dragged myself to W21 at maybe 75% intensity - the weights felt twice as heavy. Wednesday I tried to meal prep but gave up halfway through, ordering shawarma again (28 SAR). Thursday's W25 I completed but at 70% intensity with terrible form on squats - I actually felt unsafe and cut the session short. Friday's W21 I missed completely due to work running late and zero motivation. The weekend I just... collapsed. Saturday and Sunday I barely left my apartment except for food. Sleep was catastrophic - averaged 6.0 hours with three nights under 6 hours. I'm in serious sleep debt now, walking around in a fog. My nutrition fell to about 88% of target (2270 kcal average) because I just couldn't bring myself to cook most days. Protein dropped to 138g/day. Budget exploded to 52.3 SAR/day (130% overage) from takeout meals - I ordered out 5 times this week. I gained another 0.4kg but I can see it's not muscle - my midsection is noticeably softer, face looks puffy. The mirror shows minimal muscle development despite 6 weeks of effort. I'm experiencing what I now recognize as acute burnout: I don't want to work out, meal prep feels like torture, I dread the gym, and I'm seriously questioning if this is worth it. The beginner excitement is completely gone. I'm tired all the time, irritable, and my work performance is suffering. I need to make serious changes or quit entirely. This isn't sustainable."
P01,2026-W07,15.5,30.5,72.1,2420,6,"First week was challenging but motivating! I managed to stick to the meal plan about 75% of the time. The Ful Medames breakfast was filling and easy to prepare even with my beginner cooking skills. I struggled a bit with the advanced gym workouts since I'm at beginner fitness level - had to reduce weights and take longer rest periods. The Beef Kabsa took me longer to cook than expected, so I meal-prepped it twice this week. Training 4 days went well, though I felt pretty sore after the upper body sessions. Energy levels were decent despite only getting around 6 hours of sleep. The date and nut energy balls were a great pre-workout snack. I noticed I'm eating more consistently throughout the day which feels good. Some days I was too tired after work and skipped the fourth meal or had something simpler. Overall, I can feel my muscles working and I'm optimistic about continuing."

P01,2026-W09,15.6,28.5,66.3,2340,6.93,"Week 9 of 2026 complete! Started at 65.9kg and honestly felt pretty good going into this. My adherence was solid at around 75% which matches my usual pattern. Hit 3 full workouts (W25 and W21 alternating) and one shortened session on Thursday when work ran late. 

Meal prep was basic but effective - lots of grilled chicken, rice, and dates for quick carbs. Skipped breakfast on Wednesday because I overslept, but made up calories later. Ate out once on Friday and the sodium was definitely higher that day, felt a bit bloated Saturday morning. 

Workouts felt challenging but doable. W25 (upper body focus) left me sore for a couple days each time. W21 (lower body) was tough on the legs but I'm seeing better form. Evening training window after 6pm worked perfectly with my schedule.

Energy levels were good most days thanks to the 7 hours sleep. Budget of 40 SAR/day was tight but manageable - chicken and rice are cheap, dates and eggs helped fill gaps. Bought some whey protein mid-week which helped hit protein targets.

Body-wise, I can see a bit more definition in my arms and shoulders. Scale shows small gains which makes sense for early muscle-building. Feeling motivated to keep the streak going!"
P01,2026-W10,15.4,28.9,67.1,2447,6.86,"Week 10 of 2026 complete! Started at 66.3kg and finished at 67.1kg - solid 0.8kg gain which feels mostly clean given my waist measurements haven't changed much. The four workout days were challenging but manageable at my beginner level. Monday and Friday's W25 sessions (full-body strength) left me properly sore for 48 hours each time, especially in quads and chest. Wednesday and Saturday's W21 workouts (upper body focus) were shorter but intense - though Saturday I only managed 30 minutes instead of the full 45 due to a family commitment.

Sticking to the 2495 kcal target on my 40 SAR daily budget required smart shopping. I bulk-bought chicken breast on sale (18 SAR/kg), rice (cheap staple), eggs, bananas, dates for quick carbs, and seasonal vegetables. My beginner cooking skills meant mostly grilled chicken, rice bowls, scrambled eggs, and simple stir-fries, but I hit my macros pretty consistently. Day 3 I skipped breakfast rushing to work, and Day 5 I ate out with friends - that restaurant meal was way saltier than my usual prep, felt a bit bloated the next morning.

Sleep averaged just under 7 hours (6.93 target), though Day 6 I only got 6.5 hours. Recovery felt adequate but not amazing - I'm definitely feeling the cumulative fatigue by Saturday. The muscle soreness pattern was predictable: sore Days 2-3 after Monday's session, recovered by Wednesday, then sore again Days 5-6 after Friday's workout.

My 75% adherence propensity played out realistically - I completed all four planned workouts (though one shortened), hit nutrition targets 5 out of 7 days fully, and maintained the routine despite some time pressure. No injuries, form is improving as I get more comfortable with the movements. Definitely seeing some pump in my arms and shoulders, and the scale moving up is motivating. The beginner gains are real!

Challenges: meal prep gets boring with limited cooking skills, sleep could be better for recovery, and balancing work/social life with the routine takes discipline. But overall feeling strong and the routine is becoming habit. Ready to keep pushing next week."

Struggled a bit with the lamb mandi dinner twice because of budget constraints, so I substituted with chicken. The advanced workouts were really tough for a beginner like me - I had to scale down the weights significantly and couldn't complete all sets on upper body day. My arms and legs were super sore, especially after the first leg session. Sleep stayed around my usual 6-7 hours because of work schedule.

The kabsa took longer to prepare than expected with my beginner cooking skills, so I ordered similar chicken and rice meals twice instead. The gym workouts were intense for my beginner level - the advanced upper body and legs sessions left me really sore for 2-3 days each.

The grilled chicken with quinoa took some practice to cook properly since I'm still learning, but YouTube tutorials helped. The advanced workouts were intense - maybe too advanced for my current level. Upper body day left me really sore for 3 days, had to take an extra rest day mid-week. Legs day was brutal but I pushed through most exercises with lighter weights than prescribed. Energy levels were good overall, noticed I was hungrier than usual which I think is a good sign.

I did skip a few meals when I got busy with work and ended up grabbing something quick instead. The gym workouts were challenging since they're marked as 'Advanced' but I'm a beginner - I had to scale down the weights significantly and couldn't complete all sets on the upper body day.

P02,2025-W47,19.2,16.62,49.7,1785,7.3,"This week was a real learning experience for me! I'm still pretty new to structured fitness and meal planning, so there were definitely some ups and downs. 

On the diet side, I managed to stick to the plan about 60-65% of the time. The meals were actually pretty filling - maybe too filling sometimes! I really loved the chicken kabsa and jarish with lamb - those were my absolute favorites and I looked forward to those days. The flavors were amazing and they kept me satisfied for hours. However, I did skip my afternoon snacks on Tuesday and Friday because I was just so full from lunch, and honestly, I was running a bit late on those days too. On Wednesday, I ate slightly smaller portions at dinner because I felt a bit bloated from the day before. The budget of 60 SAR per day was mostly manageable, though I had to be careful with my grocery shopping and stick to local markets.

For workouts, I completed all 4 sessions as planned (W25 on Monday and Wednesday, W21 on Tuesday and Thursday), which I'm really proud of! But I have to be honest - I had to modify almost everything to beginner level. The advanced exercises were just too complex for me right now. I used lighter weights than recommended, maybe 40-50% of what was suggested, and I took longer rest periods between sets. Some of the compound movements were confusing at first, and I had to watch tutorial videos on my phone between sets. My form probably wasn't perfect, but I tried my best. By Thursday, I was feeling pretty sore, especially in my legs and shoulders.

Sleep was decent - I averaged about 7.3 hours per night, which is close to my usual 7.4. I did have one rough night on Wednesday when I stayed up later than planned scrolling through social media (oops!). 

Overall, I'm feeling optimistic but realistic. I know muscle gain takes time, especially for someone like me who's just starting out. I felt a tiny bit stronger by the end of the week, and my clothes fit about the same. The scale went up very slightly, which I'm hoping is some water retention and maybe a tiny bit of muscle? I'm trying not to obsess over the numbers too much. The biggest challenge was definitely the workout complexity - I need to maybe find some beginner-specific modifications or stick with simpler programs until I build more confidence and strength. But I'm committed to keeping at it!"

Diet-wise, I managed better this week - hit about 68% adherence compared to last week's 63%. I meal prepped chicken kabsa on Sunday which saved me so much time and money. Shopping at the local market early helped me stay within my 60 SAR daily budget. I did skip my evening snack on Tuesday and Thursday because I was genuinely too full after dinner, and on Saturday I had a family gathering where I ate what was served instead of my planned meals. The jarish with lamb continues to be my favorite - it's filling and I can feel it helping with recovery.

Workouts were challenging but I'm seeing small improvements! Completed all 4 sessions (W25 on Monday and Thursday, W21 on Tuesday and Friday). I'm still using modified weights - managed to increase by about 5-10% on some exercises compared to last week, so now I'm at roughly 45-55% of recommended weights. The push-ups are getting slightly easier, though I'm still doing them on my knees. The DOMS wasn't as brutal this week - only moderate soreness on Wednesday and Saturday, which I'm taking as a good sign that my body is adapting.

Sleep averaged around 7.2 hours - pretty consistent with my usual pattern. A couple nights I stayed up later than planned scrolling through workout form videos on YouTube, which I think actually helped me feel more confident in the gym.

Biggest win: I could actually feel my arms and shoulders engaging during the exercises this week, whereas last week everything just felt awkward and difficult. My form is improving and I'm starting to understand the mind-muscle connection people talk about. Still struggling with some of the more complex movements, but I'm not as intimidated anymore.

Challenges remain around exercise complexity - I spent extra time watching tutorials before each session. Also, the gym can be crowded after work, which sometimes means waiting for equipment or feeling self-conscious. But I'm pushing through!

Overall feeling: Cautiously optimistic. I can see this is going to be a long journey, but these small improvements are motivating. My clothes fit the same, but I swear my shoulders look slightly different in the mirror. Might be wishful thinking, but I'll take it!"
P02,2025-W49,18.7,17.05,50.3,1895,7.3,"Week 3 felt like a real turning point! I'm genuinely starting to feel stronger and more confident in the gym. The DOMS is way more manageable now - just that pleasant muscle tiredness instead of the 'can't sit down properly' pain from Week 1. I hit all 4 workouts again and pushed myself to 50-60% of recommended weights, which is a solid jump from last week.

Monday's upper body workout (W25) went really well. I'm finally getting the hang of proper push-up form, even if they're still modified on my knees. The dumbbell rows felt much smoother, and I could actually feel my back muscles working instead of just my arms getting tired. Tuesday's diet was spot-on - meal prep is becoming second nature now.

Wednesday's lower body session (W21) was challenging but in a good way. Squats are getting deeper, and I managed to add a bit more weight to the goblet squats. My legs were shaky afterward, but I felt accomplished. Thursday I was pretty tired from work and only hit about 60% of my protein target - grabbed some quick snacks instead of my planned meal.

Friday's repeat of W25 showed real progress. I could do an extra rep on most exercises, and my shoulder stability has improved noticeably. The overhead presses don't feel as awkward anymore. Saturday's W21 workout was solid, though I was a bit distracted thinking about a friend's birthday dinner that evening. I did go over budget by about 15 SAR that day with the restaurant meal, but I made healthier choices - grilled chicken and rice instead of fried options.

Sunday was pure rest and meal prep. I spent about 2 hours in the kitchen and actually enjoyed it! Made my chicken and rice bowls, prepped vegetables, and even tried a new lentil recipe that turned out decent. My cooking skills are definitely improving alongside my fitness.

The scale is moving in the right direction, and I can see subtle changes in my arms and shoulders. My clothes fit a bit differently - tighter in the shoulders, which feels amazing! Sleep has been consistent around 7-7.5 hours. I'm learning to listen to my body better and adjust intensity when needed. The 65% adherence goal feels very achievable now, and I'm actually exceeding it on most days. Excited to keep this momentum going!"
P02,2025-W50,18.4,17.25,50.6,1895,7.4,"Week 4 felt like a breakthrough week! I completed all 4 scheduled workouts (W25, W21, W25, W21) and honestly felt stronger each session. The DOMS is barely noticeable now - just a pleasant reminder that I worked hard rather than the hobbling-around pain from Week 1. I'm officially at 60% of recommended loads on most exercises, which feels incredible considering where I started.

Diet adherence was around 73-75% this week, my best yet! Meal prep on Sunday has become almost therapeutic - I actually enjoy the process now. I experimented with a new chicken seasoning blend and made a big batch of quinoa that lasted most of the week. My breakfast routine (Greek yogurt with berries and granola) is so automatic now that I don't even think about it.

Tuesday's workout was particularly satisfying - I hit 3 sets of 12 push-ups (modified but with better form) and felt my shoulders and triceps really engaging. Thursday I noticed in the mirror that my shoulders have visible definition now, which was a huge motivation boost. My posture has improved so much that a coworker actually commented on it!

The challenging moments: Wednesday I had a late work meeting and almost skipped my workout, but I pushed through and did it at 8 PM instead of my usual 6 PM. It threw off my dinner timing and I ended up eating a bit late, but I still hit my protein target. Friday I was craving pizza badly (it was my roommate's birthday celebration) and I did have two slices, which put me about 20 SAR over budget for the day, but I made up for it by having a lighter breakfast and lunch on Saturday.

Sleep has been solid - averaging 7.4 hours, which I think is helping with recovery. I'm waking up feeling more energized than I did in Weeks 1-2. My appetite has definitely increased, which makes sense given the training, but I'm managing it well with the higher protein intake keeping me satisfied.

The rowing motion finally clicked for me this week - I can feel my back muscles working properly now instead of just using my arms. Squats still feel a bit awkward but I'm getting deeper with better knee tracking. I'm excited to see what Week 5 brings. The habit is definitely forming - I actually look forward to my workout days now rather than dreading them!"
P02,2025-W51,18.2,17.45,51.1,2015,7.3,"Week 5 is complete and I'm honestly amazed at how this has become part of my routine now. Started the week at 50.6kg and ended at 51.1kg - that half-kilo gain feels earned and intentional, not just random fluctuation. All 4 workouts completed again, making this my second consecutive perfect week. The W25 full-body sessions on Monday and Friday felt powerful - I'm now using 65% of recommended weights on most compound movements, up from 60% last week. My goblet squats hit 12kg for 3 sets of 10 and my form felt solid throughout. The W21 upper body days (Wednesday and Saturday) showed real progress too - push-ups are getting smoother and I managed 8 consecutive proper-form reps before needing a knee modification.

Diet adherence averaged around 72% this week, which is slightly down from last week's 73-75%, but honestly still feels sustainable. I had two challenging days: Tuesday when I stayed late at the library studying and grabbed a shawarma wrap that pushed me 250 kcal over target, and Thursday when my roommate made kunafa and I couldn't resist (worth it, but added about 400 kcal). I compensated both times by adjusting the following day's portions. My Sunday meal prep included a new experiment - I marinated chicken thighs in yogurt and za'atar overnight, then grilled them. Game changer for flavor! Made the whole week's lunches more exciting.

Protein intake stayed strong at 118-128g daily range. I'm getting better at hitting my targets even on busier days. My go-to quick protein sources are now automatic: Greek yogurt with honey in the morning, chicken or eggs at lunch, and usually fish or more chicken at dinner. I've also discovered that adding a scoop of protein powder to my morning oats makes a huge difference in keeping me full until lunch.

The visible changes are becoming undeniable. My roommate commented again this week that my shoulders look 'more athletic' and I can see definition in my deltoids that wasn't there a month ago. My posture continues to improve - I catch myself sitting straighter without thinking about it. The mind-muscle connection during rows is incredible now; I can really feel my lats doing the work instead of just yanking with my arms.

Sleep averaged 7.3 hours this week, just slightly below my usual 7.4, mostly because I had a couple of nights where I was too excited about a project deadline and stayed up reading. Energy levels remained high though, and I didn't feel it impacting my workouts. Recovery has been excellent - DOMS is now just a pleasant reminder that I worked hard, not the debilitating soreness I experienced in weeks 1-2.

One unexpected win: I successfully navigated a family gathering on Saturday evening (after my morning workout). Instead of mindlessly eating everything offered, I made conscious choices - filled my plate with grilled meats and salads, had one small piece of baklava instead of three, and felt completely satisfied. This felt like a huge mental shift from my old all-or-nothing thinking.

Budget management was solid - averaged 58 SAR per day, staying comfortably within my 60 SAR limit. The shawarma splurge on Tuesday was only 18 SAR, and I balanced it by making simpler meals the next day. My grocery shopping is getting more efficient; I know exactly what I need and where to find the best deals.

Challenges this week: Wednesday's workout almost didn't happen because I woke up feeling unusually tired, but I pushed through with a slightly lighter intensity and felt great afterward. This taught me that sometimes showing up is more important than being perfect. Also struggled a bit with staying hydrated mid-week - need to keep my water bottle more visible.

Looking ahead to Week 6, I'm planning to increase weights another 5% on my main lifts and maybe experiment with some unilateral exercises to address any strength imbalances. I'm also going to try a new recipe - salmon with roasted vegetables - that fits my macros perfectly. The momentum feels unstoppable right now. This isn't a diet or a workout program anymore; it's just how I live. That realization hit me during Friday's workout when I caught myself smiling while doing lunges. Who smiles during lunges?! Apparently, I do now."
P02,2025-W52,18,17.65,51.4,2115,7.2,"Week 6 felt like a breakthrough week! I hit all 4 workouts (Monday W25, Wednesday W21, Friday W25, Saturday W21) and the 5% load increases felt challenging but manageable. My goblet squats went up to 12.5kg for 3x10 and I'm genuinely proud of maintaining form throughout. The shoulder press with 6kg dumbbells felt solid - I can really feel my delts working now.

Diet adherence was around 68% this week, slightly lower than Week 5 but still reasonable. I had a family dinner on Thursday where I ate more than planned (lamb kabsa with extra rice, probably +350 kcal), and on Sunday I celebrated a friend's birthday with cake (+280 kcal). I compensated by reducing portions the next days and keeping protein high. My za'atar chicken meal prep continues to be a lifesaver - I made a double batch on Saturday.

Protein intake ranged from 115-132g daily, averaging about 124g which I'm happy with. I noticed I'm genuinely hungry before meals now, which I think means my metabolism is responding to the training. My energy levels were consistently good except for Friday when I only slept 6.5 hours due to staying up late with family visiting.

The visible changes are motivating me so much! My shoulders have more definition, and I can see the beginning of arm shape when I flex. An aunt commented that I look 'stronger' which made my day. I also noticed my posture has improved - I'm naturally standing taller.

Form improvements: I did 10 consecutive push-ups with proper form (chest to ground!), and my lat pulldowns feel so much more connected. I'm really focusing on pulling with my elbows and feeling my back muscles engage. The mind-muscle connection is clicking.

Budget averaged 59 SAR/day - slightly over but worth it for the quality protein sources. I invested in some whey protein powder (120 SAR for the month) which helps hit my targets on busy days.

Hydration was better this week - I'm consciously drinking water between sets and keeping a bottle at my desk. Still not perfect but improving.

One challenge: my lower back felt tight after Saturday's workout (deadlift pattern in W21). I spent extra time stretching and foam rolling, and it felt better by Sunday. I think I need to focus more on core bracing.

Mental state is excellent. Training has become a genuine highlight of my week, not a chore. I'm sleeping well (except that one night), recovering fine, and feeling genuinely strong. The habit is solidified - I don't even question whether I'll work out, I just plan when.

Ready for Week 7 with confidence!"
P02,2026-W01,17.7,17.85,51.7,1945,7.1,"Week 7 complete! This was honestly one of my best weeks yet. I hit all 4 workouts (W25 and W21 alternating) and felt really strong throughout. Monday's W25 session was challenging but I managed the progressive overload - added weight to my goblet squats and rows like planned. Wednesday's W21 felt smoother than ever, my push-ups are getting so much better! I did 12 consecutive proper form ones during the workout.

Diet-wise, I tracked everything carefully and stayed pretty close to targets most days. My adherence was around 70% this week - I had one unplanned deviation on Tuesday when work colleagues brought kunafa and I couldn't resist (added maybe 300 kcal), but I adjusted Wednesday's dinner to compensate. Thursday I was slightly under on protein (only 108g) because I ran out of chicken and couldn't get to the store until Friday. Weekend was solid though - meal prepped on Friday evening which made Saturday and Sunday much easier.

Saturday's W25 workout was TOUGH. I really pushed myself on the deadlifts and felt it in my hamstrings and glutes for two days after. Sunday's W21 was a nice active recovery style session. My shoulders are visibly more defined now - I can actually see the separation between my delts and arms when I flex. My jeans are fitting differently too, tighter in the thighs and glutes but looser in the waist.

Sleep was decent, averaged about 7.1 hours. Had one rough night on Thursday (only 6.3 hours) because of work stress, but caught up Friday night with 8 hours. Energy levels have been consistently high, and I'm noticing I'm genuinely hungry before meals now - my metabolism is definitely responding to the training.

Budget stayed within limits at 58 SAR/day average. I'm getting better at finding protein sources that don't break the bank. Eggs, lentils, and chicken thighs are my staples. Bought some whey protein on sale which helps with the protein targets.

Minor notes: some DOMS in my quads mid-week but nothing concerning. Lower back feels great - the core work and stretching routine I added is really helping. Hydration was excellent all week, consistently hitting 2.5+ liters. Mentally, I feel amazing. Training is the highlight of my day now, not a chore. I'm genuinely excited to see where I'll be in another month. The habit is completely locked in.

Ready to tackle Week 8 with continued progressive overload. Thinking about adding an extra 2.5kg to my squats next week."
P02,2026-W02,17.4,18.15,52.1,1978,7,"Week 8 (2026-W02) complete! This was a solid week with some real-world challenges that tested my adherence, but I'm proud of how I navigated them. Started Monday strong with W25 - the goblet squats at increased load felt challenging but manageable, hit 15 reps on my last set which felt amazing. Tuesday's W21 upper body session showed continued progress on push-ups (managed 13 consecutive!), though my shoulders were quite fatigued by the end. 

Mid-week got tricky - Wednesday I had a family gathering that threw off my meal timing and I ended up about 250 kcal over target with higher fat intake (traditional kabsa with extra ghee). I didn't stress about it and got right back on track Thursday. Thursday's W25 session was tough after the previous day's overeating - felt a bit sluggish on deadlifts but pushed through with good form. Friday I intentionally ate slightly under target (1850 kcal) to balance the week, and it felt fine.

Saturday's W21 was probably my best upper body workout yet - really felt the mind-muscle connection on dumbbell rows and my form is getting so much cleaner. Sunday was active recovery with a long walk and extra stretching. 

Diet adherence was about 68% this week - the Wednesday gathering was unplanned, and I had one day (Friday) where protein was 115g instead of 125g due to running out of chicken and the store being crowded (avoided the hassle). Average protein still hit 122g/day which I'm happy with. Budget stayed at 59 SAR/day average - had to buy protein powder mid-week which was a bigger expense but will last.

Physically, I'm seeing continued changes - my sports bra fits differently across the shoulders, and I caught myself flexing in the mirror after my shower (not gonna lie, felt good!). The scale went up slightly but I can see it's muscle - my jeans are tighter in the thighs and glutes but looser in the waist. DOMS was significant after both W25 sessions, especially in quads and glutes, but it's the good kind of sore.

Sleep averaged 7.0 hours - had two nights at 6.5 hours due to work deadlines, but compensated with an 8-hour night on Saturday. Energy levels stayed high throughout the week despite the sleep dips. Hydration was excellent (2.5-3L daily).

Mentally, I'm still riding high on this routine. Even on Wednesday when I overindulged, I didn't spiral or feel guilty - just acknowledged it and moved on. Training remains the highlight of my day. The progressive overload is working and I can feel myself getting genuinely stronger. Ready to keep pushing in Week 9!"
P02,2026-W03,17.3,18.35,52.4,2035,7.1,"Week 9 was another solid week with strong momentum carrying forward from Week 8! I hit all 4 workouts as planned (W25, W21, W25, W21) and the progressive overload is really showing results now. I managed 15 consecutive push-ups on my final W25 session - that's 2 more than last week! My squat form feels locked in and I'm handling the increased load confidently.

Diet adherence was around 70% this week, which is slightly better than last week. I tracked carefully and averaged about 2035 kcal daily - just slightly over target but totally manageable. Protein intake was solid at 128g/day average, with only one day (Saturday) dipping to 118g when I had a lighter lunch. I did have one planned social event on Friday evening where I went about 200 kcal over, but I adjusted Saturday morning to compensate.

Physically, I'm noticing my shoulders are more defined and my upper back has visible muscle development that wasn't there even two weeks ago. My jeans fit differently around my glutes and thighs - in a good way! The scale went up slightly but I can see in the mirror and feel in my clothes that this is quality tissue. DOMS was moderate after the W25 sessions but nothing that interfered with daily activities.

Sleep averaged 7.1 hours this week - I had three nights at 7.5 hours which felt amazing, and managed to keep even my worst night at 6.5 hours. Recovery felt excellent overall. Hydration stayed consistent at 2.8-3L daily. Budget was 58 SAR/day, so I'm actually saving a bit while hitting my nutrition targets.

Mentally, I'm in such a good place. Training is completely automatic now - I don't negotiate with myself about whether to work out, I just do it. I'm also really proud of how I handled the social event on Friday; I enjoyed myself without guilt and made a small adjustment the next day. This feels sustainable and healthy.

Core work continues to feel important for injury prevention, especially as I increase loads. No issues whatsoever. Ready to keep building in Week 10!"
P02,2026-W04,17.1,18.55,52.7,2045,7.2,"Week 10 went incredibly well! I'm honestly amazed at how training has become such a natural part of my routine now. All four workouts completed as planned (W25, W21, W25, W21) with noticeable strength gains across the board. My push-ups are getting so much easier - I managed 17 consecutive reps on Thursday which felt amazing! The squat progression is really clicking too; I added another 2.5kg to my working sets and my form felt solid throughout.

Diet adherence was around 68% this week, which I'm happy with. I averaged about 2045 kcal daily, staying in that slight surplus zone that's been working so well for me. Protein intake was consistent at 127g average, though Tuesday I only hit 115g because I got caught up with work and didn't prep my afternoon snack properly. Friday night I went out with friends and definitely went over by about 250 kcal, but I didn't stress about it - just enjoyed myself and got back on track Saturday.

The physical changes are becoming more obvious now. My shoulders have this nice rounded look that wasn't there before, and I can actually see muscle definition in my upper back when I look in the mirror. My jeans are fitting differently around my glutes and thighs - tighter in a good way! A coworker even commented that I look stronger, which made my day.

DOMS was moderate, mostly in my quads after the second W25 session, but nothing that interfered with daily activities. Recovery has been excellent overall. Sleep averaged 7.2 hours this week - I had four nights at 7.5 hours which felt amazing, two nights at 7 hours, and one rough night at 6.5 hours when I stayed up too late watching a series (oops). I can definitely feel the difference in my energy levels when I get that extra half hour.

Budget came in at 57 SAR/day, so well within limits. I've gotten really good at meal prepping on Sundays which saves both money and time during the week. Hydration stayed consistent at 2.9-3.2L daily - I've made it a habit to always have my water bottle with me.

Mentally, I'm in such a good place. Training feels like something I do for myself, not something I have to do. I love the challenge of progressive overload and seeing what my body can accomplish. My relationship with food continues to feel healthy and flexible - I can enjoy social occasions without guilt and get back to my routine naturally. The core work I've been doing is definitely paying off; my lower back feels strong and stable even as I increase weights.

Looking forward to Week 11 and continuing this momentum!"
P02,2026-W05,16.9,18.72,53,2070,7.3,"Week 11 complete and I'm honestly amazed at how my body keeps responding! Started Monday with W25 and hit 18 consecutive push-ups - that's one more than last week! The squat progression felt solid with the added 2.5kg from last week, though my quads were screaming by Thursday. Managed all four workouts (W25, W21, W25, W21) as planned, which feels like a huge win for consistency.

Diet-wise, I tracked around 67% adherence this week - slightly down from last week's 68%, but still in my normal range. Had a birthday dinner on Wednesday that pushed me about 300 kcal over target, but I didn't stress about it and just got back on track Thursday. My daily average came in around 2070 kcal, which keeps me in that slight surplus sweet spot. Protein averaged 129g/day across the week - Tuesday was lower at 118g because I ran out of Greek yogurt and forgot to grab more until evening.

The physical changes are becoming undeniable now. My shoulders have this rounded look even in regular t-shirts, and I caught my reflection at the gym between sets and actually saw back definition I've never had before. My jeans are tighter in the thighs and glutes - in a good way! A friend at coffee on Saturday literally asked if I've been 'hitting the gym hard' which made me grin like an idiot.

DOMS was real after Tuesday's W25 session - my quads were so sore Wednesday morning I walked down stairs like a newborn giraffe. But recovery was good overall, probably helped by the 7.3 hours average sleep I managed this week. Had one rough night Friday (6.8 hours - stayed up watching a series finale, oops) but bounced back with 7.8 hours Saturday.

Budget stayed comfortable at 58 SAR/day. I'm getting better at meal prepping on Sundays which helps both my wallet and my adherence. Hydration was solid, averaging about 3L daily - I've noticed I'm naturally thirstier with the increased training volume.

Mentally, I'm in such a good place. Training doesn't feel like a chore anymore; it's genuinely the highlight of my day. Even on the tough days when squats feel heavy, I love the challenge. My relationship with food feels healthy - I can enjoy social occasions without guilt and get back to my plan naturally. The progressive overload is working beautifully; I'm adding reps or weight almost every session now.

Core strength is definitely supporting the heavier loads - my bracing during squats feels much more solid than a month ago. Looking ahead to week 12, I'm thinking about adding another 2.5kg to squats if form stays clean, and maybe attempting 19 push-ups. This lean mass building phase is exceeding my expectations!"
P02,2026-W06,16.7,18.89,53.4,2085,7.4,"Week 12 completed with strong consistency! I managed to hit all 4 scheduled workouts (W25, W21, W25, W21) exactly as planned, which felt amazing. The push-up progression continues - I reached 19 consecutive reps this week, adding another rep to my PR from week 11. My shoulders are burning in the best way possible, and I can really see the definition when I look in the mirror now.

Diet adherence came in at 68%, slightly better than last week. I averaged around 2085 kcal daily, which kept me in that productive surplus zone. Protein intake was solid at 131g/day average - I made sure to stock up on Greek yogurt this time after last week's shortage. Had one day where I only hit 121g due to a rushed morning and skipping my mid-morning snack, but I compensated the next day.

Tuesday's W25 workout absolutely destroyed my quads again - those heavy squats are no joke! I maintained the load from week 10/11 and my form felt locked in. The DOMS peaked around Thursday but didn't interfere with my second W25 session on Friday. Recovery has been really good overall, probably thanks to keeping my sleep consistent.

Speaking of sleep, I averaged 7.4 hours this week - a slight improvement! Five nights I got between 7.4-7.9 hours, one night was 7.2 hours, and one night dropped to 6.9 hours when I stayed up watching a series (oops). But overall, much better than previous weeks.

Budget stayed under control at 57 SAR/day. I'm getting better at meal planning and buying in bulk, which helps a lot. Hydration was consistent at 3.0-3.2L daily - I've made it a habit to carry my water bottle everywhere.

Physically, the changes are becoming really noticeable. My jeans are definitely tighter around my thighs and glutes - I might need to size up soon! My upper back has these visible lines now when I flex, and my shoulders look rounder even in regular t-shirts. A coworker asked if I've been working out, which was such a confidence boost.

Mentally, I'm in a great place. Training feels less like an obligation and more like something I genuinely look forward to. I love the challenge of adding weight or reps each week. My relationship with food continues to be healthy - I had a dinner out with friends on Saturday where I went about 280 kcal over target, but I didn't stress about it and just ate slightly lighter on Sunday. That flexibility is really important to me.

Core strength is definitely supporting my compound lifts better. I can feel my abs engaging throughout squats and overhead presses, which makes everything feel more stable. The progressive overload approach is working perfectly - I feel challenged but not overwhelmed.

Looking ahead to week 13, I'm excited to see if I can hit 20 push-ups and maybe add a bit more weight to my squats. The momentum is real!"
P02,2026-W07,16.5,19.05,53.7,2095,7.3,"Week 13 wrapped up and I'm genuinely pleased with how things progressed! All four workouts completed as planned (W25 Monday, W21 Wednesday, W25 Friday, W21 Saturday), and I hit 20 consecutive push-ups on Friday—feels amazing to break that threshold! Squats continue feeling solid, though I noticed some fatigue accumulation by Saturday's W21 session. My quads were talking to me Thursday morning after Monday's leg-focused W25, but nothing that interfered with training.

Diet adherence landed around 67%, which is right in my comfort zone. Averaged about 2095 kcal daily—slightly above target but still appropriate for my muscle gain phase. Protein stayed consistent at 128g/day average, with one dip to 118g on Tuesday when I overslept and skipped my mid-morning snack. Made up for it Wednesday with an extra serving of Greek yogurt.

Had a spontaneous dinner out Thursday evening (Valentine's week belated celebration with friends) that pushed me about +320 kcal over, but I balanced it Friday and Saturday with slightly lighter portions. No guilt, just smart adjustments—my relationship with food feels really healthy right now.

Physically, I'm noticing my shoulders have this nice rounded look even at rest now, and my upper back definition is getting more pronounced. Tried on my favorite jeans and they're definitely snugger in the thighs and glutes—in a good way! A gym regular asked me about my program on Saturday, which was validating.

Sleep averaged 7.3 hours this week—five nights between 7.3-7.8hr, one night at 7.0hr (stayed up watching a series finale), and one at 6.8hr Wednesday due to early morning work commitment. Recovery still felt good overall. Budget came in at 58 SAR/day thanks to continued bulk buying and meal prep efficiency. Hydration stayed strong at 3.1L daily average.

Mentally, I'm in a great place. Training feels like a highlight of my day rather than an obligation, and I'm excited to see where the next phase takes me. The progressive overload is clearly working—strength gains are steady and visible changes keep me motivated. Ready to tackle week 14!"
P02,2026-W08,16.3,19.25,54.1,2088,7.3,"Week 14 wrapped up and I'm feeling really solid about the consistency I maintained! Started Monday with W25 workout - push-ups hit 21 reps which is another +1 from last week, that linear progression is so motivating. Squats felt powerful though I noticed some accumulated fatigue by the third set. Tuesday's diet was spot-on at 2080 kcal with 130g protein. Wednesday W21 session was smooth, recovery felt good. Thursday I had a work colleague's birthday lunch - went over by about 280 kcal but I planned for it and adjusted Friday's portions slightly. The social flexibility without guilt is something I'm really proud of maintaining. Friday's W25 workout was strong, no DOMS issues carried over. Saturday W21 completed all sets, though my quads were talking to me by the end. Sunday was full rest and meal prep day which set me up perfectly. My jeans are definitely tighter in the thighs and glutes - had to go up a notch on my belt which feels like a win! Noticed more shoulder cap definition when I'm just walking around, not even flexing. One gym regular asked if I'd been training longer than I have, which was a nice external validation moment. Sleep averaged 7.3 hours with one night dipping to 6.9 due to a late video call with family, but I caught up the next night with 7.7 hours. Diet adherence came in around 66% - had two days where I was slightly under target (2010 and 2025 kcal) because work got hectic and I missed my afternoon snack, but I made sure to hit protein minimums at 125g those days. Budget stayed at 57 SAR/day thanks to continued bulk buying and meal prep efficiency. Hydration consistent at 3.0-3.2L daily. The progressive overload is clearly working - I can feel my core stability improving which is helping my compound movements. Mental state remains excellent, motivation intrinsic and strong. Ready to push into week 15 with confidence!"
P02,2026-W09,16.1,19.42,54.4,2095,7.2,"Week 15 complete! I managed to stick to the plan pretty well despite some challenges. Monday and Wednesday workouts (W25) felt strong - I'm really noticing the shoulder definition continuing to develop, and my squat form is feeling more natural. The 21-rep push-up milestone from last week gave me confidence to push a bit harder. Tuesday and Thursday W21 sessions were solid recovery days with good core activation.

Diet-wise, I hit around 67% adherence this week, which is close to my usual pattern. My daily calories averaged 2095 kcal - slightly over target by about 57 kcal, but still within the surplus range I need for muscle gain. Protein averaged 128g/day across the week, which I'm happy with. I had one day (Saturday) where I only got 122g because I was out longer than expected and missed my evening snack, but the other days compensated well.

The main challenge this week was Wednesday evening - I had a work dinner that pushed me about 310 kcal over my target. I adjusted Thursday and Friday portions to balance it out, so the weekly average stayed reasonable. My meal prep on Sunday helped a lot; having pre-portioned containers made it easier to stay on track during busy workdays.

Physically, I'm feeling great. DOMS in my quads after the Friday W25 session was moderate but manageable - I've learned that walking and staying hydrated helps. My glutes are definitely growing; I can feel the difference in how my jeans fit. One of my coworkers commented that I look more 'athletic' which was a nice validation.

Sleep averaged 7.2 hours this week - a bit lower than my usual 7.3. I had two nights where I only got 6.8 hours due to early morning meetings, but I compensated with 7.6 hours on the weekend. Recovery still felt good overall.

Budget stayed at 58 SAR/day thanks to continued bulk buying and meal prep efficiency. I'm getting better at finding affordable protein sources and timing my grocery shopping for sales.

Hydration was consistent at 3.1L daily. Mental state remains excellent - I'm genuinely enjoying the process and seeing the progressive overload working. My core strength is definitely supporting my compound lifts better now. Ready to tackle week 16!"
P02,2026-W10,16,19.51,54.6,2103,6.9,"Week 16 complete and I'm genuinely proud of how I pushed through some unexpected challenges. Started strong with Monday's W25 workout - hit 22 consecutive push-ups which felt like a breakthrough after plateauing at 21 for two weeks. Tuesday's W21 session was solid, though I noticed my left shoulder was slightly fatigued from Monday's volume. Wednesday brought a work crisis that had me in back-to-back meetings until 8pm, so I had to skip the planned W25 workout entirely - first missed session in a month and it stung mentally. I made up for it Thursday morning at 6am before work, which meant getting up at 5:15am and only 6.5 hours sleep, but I refused to let the week slip. Friday's W21 was tough on that sleep deficit but I completed it with modified rest periods (90 seconds instead of 60). 

Diet-wise, this was a more challenging week. Wednesday's work crisis meant I grabbed whatever was available - ended up with a large shawarma wrap and fries that pushed me to 2,450 kcal for the day. I course-corrected Thursday and Friday by cutting back slightly, averaging around 1,950 kcal those days. Weekend was back on track. Protein stayed consistent at 125-134g daily except Wednesday (only 108g, which bothered me). My meal prep Sunday before the week started really saved me - having pre-cooked chicken breast and rice ready meant I could stay on track most days despite the chaos.

Physically, I'm seeing continued progress. My jeans are tighter in the glutes and thighs in a good way, and my roommate commented that my shoulders look broader in tank tops. The mirror shows more definition in my delts and upper back. Weight is trending up slowly which aligns with my muscle gain goal. DOMS was manageable this week, mostly in quads after Thursday's makeup W25 session. Sleep averaged lower than I'd like due to Wednesday's late night and Thursday's early alarm, plus I had trouble falling asleep Friday night (racing thoughts about work). 

Budget was tight this week at 61 SAR/day due to that emergency shawarma meal (35 SAR!) and having to buy a few items mid-week when I ran out of eggs. Hydration was good at 3.0L average. Mental state was resilient despite the setback - old me would have used Wednesday as an excuse to derail the whole week, but I adapted and kept going. The missed workout bothers me less now that I made it up. Core strength continues to support my compound movements well, and I'm ready to attempt progressive overload again next week. Overall: 3 out of 4 planned workouts completed (75%), diet adherence around 61% due to Wednesday's variance, but I maintained the right mindset and didn't let perfect be the enemy of good."
P02,2026-W11,15.7,19.65,55,1950,6.7,"This week was challenging but exciting! As a beginner, I found the advanced gym workouts really intense - I had to modify some exercises and use lighter weights than programmed. I managed to stick to the meal plan about 65% of the time. The foul medames breakfast was filling and easy to prepare, which helped with morning adherence. I struggled most with the fourth meal - sometimes I was too tired after workouts to prepare mujadara from scratch, so I'd grab something simpler or skip it. The shawarma lunch was delicious and kept me full for hours. I noticed I was hungrier than usual, probably because of the new workout routine. My sleep suffered a bit mid-week (down to 6.5 hours) due to muscle soreness keeping me up, but I adjusted by the weekend. The gym felt intimidating at first, but I'm getting more comfortable with the equipment. I can already feel my muscles working in ways they haven't before!"

I could only complete about 60% of the exercises at the prescribed weights and had to take longer rest periods. My arms and legs were super sore, especially after the first two sessions. I did notice I'm sleeping a bit better, maybe from being more tired from the workouts. The hummus snack was perfect for between classes. I struggled a bit with cooking the lamb kofta perfectly, but it got easier by the end of the week. Overall, I feel like I'm eating more protein than usual and my energy levels are pretty good.

I hit around 1850 calories daily on average because I occasionally skipped the date smoothie when I was too tired after workouts. Training 4 days per week was doable but left me quite sore. I'm sleeping about the same, maybe slightly better on rest days. I can feel my muscles working and I'm definitely getting stronger, even though the soreness was real! Looking forward to continuing but might need some form tips on the advanced exercises."
P02,2026-W41,9.7,23.8,64.3,1850,7,"This week was challenging but I'm proud I stuck with it most days! The foul medames breakfast was surprisingly filling and easy to make, which helped me stay on track in the mornings. The chicken kabsa took more effort than I expected with my beginner cooking skills, so I only made it 3 times instead of daily - on other days I grabbed grilled chicken with rice from a local spot. The gym workouts were INTENSE - I've never done advanced level training before and honestly couldn't complete all the sets. My arms were so sore after the upper body day that I had to skip one workout session. I managed about 65% adherence overall - hit my meals about 4-5 days properly, made it to the gym 3 out of 4 planned days. I'm definitely feeling stronger though, and I can see a tiny bit more definition in my shoulders. Sleep was decent, around 7 hours most nights. The hummus snack became my favorite part of the day! I think I need to adjust the workout intensity down a bit to match my beginner level better."
P02,2026-W42,9.5,24,64.7,2050,7,"This week was challenging but rewarding! I managed to stick to the meal plan about 65% of the time. The shakshuka breakfast was delicious and easy to make, though I sometimes skipped the pita when I was running late. The grilled chicken salads were filling and I actually looked forward to them. I struggled a bit with the lentil soup - my cooking skills are still developing and it didn't always turn out great, so I substituted with similar options a couple times. The date smoothie became my favorite post-workout treat! The advanced gym workouts were TOUGH - I'm definitely a beginner and had to scale back the weights significantly and take longer rest periods. My muscles were sore for days after each session, especially after the leg day. I completed all 4 planned workout days but at maybe 60-70% of the prescribed intensity. I'm feeling stronger already though, and my energy levels are good. Sleep stayed consistent around 7 hours most nights."
P02,2026-W43,9.2,24.2,65.1,1850,7,"This week was challenging but exciting! As a beginner, the advanced gym workouts were really intense - I managed to complete about 65% of the exercises as prescribed. Some of the upper body movements were tough and I had to use lighter weights than recommended. The diet was mostly good - I really enjoyed the Middle Eastern meals, especially the Chicken Majboos and Ful Medames. I stuck to the meal plan about 4-5 days out of 7. On two days I had to eat out with friends and couldn't follow it exactly. The portion sizes felt right and I wasn't too hungry. I did notice some muscle soreness, especially after the leg workouts, which I've read is normal for beginners. My energy levels were decent throughout the week. I'm motivated to continue!"
P02,2026-W44,9.1,24.3,65.5,1850,6.7,"This first week was challenging but exciting! As a beginner, the advanced gym workouts were really intense - I had to modify some exercises and use lighter weights than programmed. I managed to stick to the diet plan about 65% of the time. The shakshuka breakfast was delicious and easy to make, which helped with morning adherence. I struggled most with the 4th meal timing and sometimes skipped the nuts or crackers. The Mujadara and Koshari were new to me but I enjoyed learning to prepare them. My muscles are quite sore, especially after the upper body session, which affected my sleep on two nights. I'm eating more protein than I'm used to, and I can feel increased energy during workouts. The 2000 kcal target felt adequate most days, though post-workout hunger was real. I'm proud I showed up for all 4 workout days even when intimidated by the advanced programming."
P02,2026-W45,9,24.4,65.8,1750,6.9,"This week was challenging but I managed to stick with it most days. The meal prep was harder than I expected with my beginner cooking skills - the stuffed bell peppers took forever the first time! I followed the diet about 65% of the time, sometimes grabbing easier options when I was tired. The workouts were INTENSE - I've never done advanced level training before and my muscles are so sore. I could only complete about 60% of the exercises at the prescribed intensity. The upper body day left me barely able to lift my arms the next day. I'm sleeping slightly better though, probably from the exhaustion. I did notice I'm eating more protein than usual which feels good. The date smoothie became my favorite - easy to make and tastes amazing. I'm seeing some early changes in the mirror and feel a bit stronger already, though the scale hasn't moved much."

I could only complete about 60-70% of the exercises at the prescribed intensity. Had to skip one workout day because I was too exhausted. The hummus and pita breakfast became my favorite meal.

The lamb chops and kabsa were delicious and kept me full, though I struggled with meal prep timing since my cooking skills are basic. I skipped the ful medames twice because I woke up late and grabbed something quicker instead. The date smoothie became my favorite post-workout treat! I felt sore after the leg days but pushed through. My energy levels improved by mid-week once I adjusted to the higher protein intake. I'm proud I stuck with it 4 days in the gym as planned, though some sets were lighter than programmed."

The lentil soup with chicken became my favorite meal - very filling and tasty. I struggled a bit with the advanced gym workouts since I'm still a beginner, so I modified some exercises and used lighter weights. My arms and legs were quite sore after the first few sessions, but by day 5 I started feeling stronger. The date smoothie was surprisingly good as a post-workout snack. I missed one workout day due to work commitments. Sleep stayed consistent around 7 hours. I'm noticing slightly better energy levels and my clothes fit a tiny bit tighter around my shoulders, which I think is a good sign for muscle building!"
P03,2025-W46,23.1,30.8,77.9,1950,6.6,"Honestly, this week was tougher than I expected. The diet was pretty filling with all the protein, but I struggled to stick to it perfectly - probably hit about 60% adherence. Some days I grabbed extra snacks or had a shawarma when I was out with friends. The workouts were BRUTAL - I'm a beginner and these advanced gym programs really kicked my butt. My form probably wasn't great on a lot of exercises and I had to drop the weight significantly. The pull day especially destroyed my back and arms. Sleep was rough too, averaging around 6-7 hours because of work and staying up late. I did lose a bit of weight though which is encouraging! The ful medames breakfast was actually really good and kept me full. The kabsa for lunch was delicious but took more effort to prep than I'm used to. I think I need a program more suited to my actual fitness level because I was pretty sore and exhausted by day 3."
P03,2025-W47,22.7,30.9,77.2,1950,6.5,"This week was honestly pretty challenging. I started with good intentions but my 60% adherence propensity definitely showed. The diet plan at 2321 kcal was reasonable, but I found myself skipping breakfast on 3 days because I woke up late after poor sleep. When I did eat, the meal prep was tough with my beginner cooking skills - I ended up ordering shawarma twice and having extra snacks (chips, chocolate) on 4 evenings when I felt tired. My SAR 25/day budget was tight, so I had to choose between quality protein sources and convenience, usually going for cheaper options like eggs and chicken but sometimes just bread and cheese when rushed.

The three workouts (W33, W29, W21) were completed, but man, they kicked my butt. As a beginner, I had to modify almost everything. I reduced weights significantly - probably 40% on upper body and 30% on lower body exercises. The DOMS was real and lasted 2-3 days after each session, making daily activities uncomfortable. I noticed my form breaking down toward the end of sets, so I focused on that rather than pushing heavy weight.

Sleep remained inconsistent at 6-7 hours, which didn't help recovery. I'd crash around midnight after scrolling my phone, then struggle to wake up for work. Energy levels were moderate to low, especially on workout days. By Thursday I was questioning if I could finish the week, but I pushed through. The scale showed a small drop which was encouraging, though I know some of that is probably water weight and the fact I didn't eat as much as planned on some days. I can feel I'm slightly leaner around my waist, but the muscle soreness makes it hard to tell if I'm actually building muscle or just inflamed. Overall, a mixed week - proud I stuck with the workouts but know my nutrition wasn't on point."
P03,2025-W48,22.5,31,76.8,2015,6.5,"Week 48 was a continuation of the struggle I've been facing. Started at 77.2kg and honestly, I'm feeling pretty burned out. The budget is still tight at 25 SAR/day, which makes hitting those macros really tough. I managed to stick to workouts on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but the diet side was messy again.

Monday started okay - I actually ate breakfast (scrambled eggs and bread), but by Tuesday I was back to skipping it because I overslept. The 6.5 hours of sleep isn't cutting it; I'm waking up groggy and unmotivated. Wednesday's workout (W29 - Upper Body Push) was brutal. I had to drop the weights even more than last week, maybe down to 50% of what the program suggested. My shoulders were screaming during overhead press.

Mid-week I gave in to cheap shawarma twice because I didn't meal prep and was starving after work. That blew my sodium through the roof and I felt bloated Thursday morning. The fiber target of 40g? Forget it. I'm averaging maybe 20-25g because vegetables are expensive and I keep defaulting to rice and chicken.

Friday's workout (W21 - Lower Body) left me barely able to walk by Saturday. The DOMS in my quads was so bad I had to skip going out with friends. I iced them and just lay around most of the weekend. Sunday I tried to do better with food - made a big batch of rice, chicken, and whatever vegetables were on sale (zucchini and carrots). Got closer to my protein target that day at least.

The scale shows a small drop, but I think it's mostly water weight from the workout inflammation going down. My pants fit about the same. Energy levels are low, probably from the combination of under-eating (I'm guessing I averaged around 2000 kcal again, not the 2354 target), poor sleep, and the physical stress. I can see very slight definition in my arms when I flex, but it might just be wishful thinking.

Positives: I did complete all 3 workouts, even if they were modified. I'm learning to cook chicken better - less dry now. Started drinking more water which helped with the soreness a bit.

Negatives: Diet adherence was maybe 55% this week. Too much reliance on cheap fast food. Still not sleeping enough. Recovery is taking forever. Feeling discouraged about the slow progress.

Going into Week 49, I need to figure out a better breakfast solution that doesn't require me to wake up earlier. Maybe overnight oats? Also need to find cheaper protein sources. The grind continues."
P03,2025-W49,22.3,31.1,76.3,2090,6.5,"Week 49 was honestly pretty rough. I started Monday motivated after the weekend meal prep, but by Wednesday I was dragging hard from the lack of sleep. The 6.5 hours just isn't cutting it—I'm waking up groggy and hitting that afternoon crash around 2-3 PM every day. My budget got tight mid-week, so I ended up at a fast food place twice (Wednesday dinner and Friday lunch) which totally blew my sodium and fat targets. I skipped breakfast on Tuesday and Thursday because I overslept and had to rush out.

The workouts were... mixed. I got all three sessions in (Monday W33, Wednesday W29, Friday W21), which I'm proud of, but I had to drop the weights significantly again—probably 35-45% lighter than prescribed. My legs were absolutely destroyed after Friday's W21 session. Like, I could barely walk down stairs on Saturday. That DOMS is no joke. I tried to push through on the upper body stuff, but my form was getting sloppy by the end of sets.

Food-wise, I did okay on some days. The Sunday meal prep helped for Monday and Tuesday lunches (chicken and rice bowls), but by mid-week I was just grabbing whatever was quick and cheap. I think I averaged around 2100 calories most days, maybe a bit less on the days I skipped breakfast. Protein was okay when I remembered my shakes, but carbs were all over the place. I did drink more water this week though—kept a bottle at my desk and actually refilled it.

The scale barely moved, maybe down half a kilo, but I'm so bloated from the sodium that I don't trust it. I don't really see any visual changes yet. Energy levels were low all week, and I found myself needing coffee just to function at work. I know the sleep is the main issue, but I keep staying up too late scrolling on my phone.

Positives: I didn't quit, I got my three workouts done, and I'm learning what I can realistically handle on this budget. But I need to figure out the sleep thing and maybe find cheaper protein sources because the fast food is killing my progress."
P03,2025-W50,22,31,75.8,2150,6.5,"Week 50 was a grind, honestly. Coming off that brutal DOMS from W21, I started Monday still feeling it in my quads and glutes. The budget stayed tight at 25 SAR/day which meant I had to get creative, but I slipped up twice with cheap shawarma wraps when I was too tired to cook. Sleep stayed around 6.5 hours—I know it's not enough, but work and life don't stop.

Workouts were scheduled for 3 days (W33, W29, W21 again), and I managed to show up for all three, but the intensity wasn't where it should be. Monday's W33 session felt heavy; I had to drop weights by about 40% on squats and my form started breaking down in the last sets. Wednesday's W29 was better—more cardio-focused, which my legs appreciated. Friday's W21 was déjà vu; I knew what was coming and tried to pace myself, but still ended up completely smoked by the end.

Diet-wise, I hit maybe 60% adherence. I prepped on Sunday—chicken breast, rice, and some veggies—but by Wednesday I was out of prepped meals and grabbed fast food twice. Skipped breakfast on Tuesday and Thursday because I overslept. My protein intake was around 150g/day on average, short of the 179g target. Carbs were closer to 320g instead of 360g, and I definitely went over on sodium at least 4 days from processed stuff and restaurant meals. Estimated daily intake was around 2150 kcal, which is about 90% of my 2382 target.

Fiber was low again—maybe 22g/day. I tried to drink more water and that actually went well; kept a bottle with me at work. Energy levels were inconsistent; mornings were rough, and I felt foggy until mid-afternoon. The workouts gave me a temporary boost but then I'd crash hard in the evening.

Physically, I can see minor changes—maybe a bit leaner around the midsection, but it's hard to tell day-to-day. The scale dropped slightly, probably a mix of water weight and a small fat loss. Muscle mass feels about the same; I'm not eating or sleeping enough to build much. The fatigue is real though—I'm constantly tired, and it's affecting everything from workout performance to meal decisions.

Barriers this week: budget is still the biggest one. I can't afford high-quality protein sources every day, so I'm relying on cheaper cuts and occasional eggs. Time is another—cooking after work when I'm exhausted just doesn't happen consistently. Sleep is a choice I'm making poorly; I stay up too late scrolling or watching stuff, then regret it the next morning.

Overall, I'd say this was a 58-60% adherence week. I showed up for the workouts, but they weren't great. Diet was inconsistent. Sleep was inadequate. I'm making progress, but it's slow and frustrating. I need to get my meal prep more consistent and force myself to bed earlier. The fat loss goal is happening, just not as fast as I'd like."
P03,2025-W51,21.7,31.1,75.3,2230,6.5,"Week 51 was a grind, honestly. Started strong on Monday but by Wednesday I was already feeling the budget crunch and sleep debt piling up. Hit all three workouts (W33, W29, W21) but had to scale back weights again—probably working at 55-65% of prescribed loads. The DOMS from W21 last time wasn't as bad this round, so my body's adapting a bit. Skipped breakfast twice (Tuesday and Friday) because I overslept and had to rush out. Ended up grabbing fast food Wednesday lunch and Saturday dinner when meal prep ran out and I was too tired to cook. The diet plan is solid when I can stick to it, but 25 SAR/day is tight—had to swap some proteins for cheaper options mid-week (more eggs, less chicken). Sleep stayed around 6.5 hours most nights; I know I need more but work and life just don't allow it right now. Energy-wise, I'm functional but not thriving—afternoon slumps are real. I can see a tiny bit more definition in my abs when I flex, which is motivating. Sodium went over target 3 days this week (fast food culprits). Hydration was better—kept a water bottle with me. Protein averaged around 155g/day, carbs around 260g, fiber maybe 24g. Calories probably hit 2200-2250 daily. I'm learning to cook simple stuff but still rely on repetitive meals. No injuries, just general fatigue. Weight feels slightly down, clothes fit a bit looser. Muscle mass feels stable, maybe tiny gains in arms from the push work. Overall adherence maybe 62% this week—not perfect but I'm showing up."
P03,2025-W52,21.3,31.2,74.7,2150,6.4,"Week 52 was a mixed bag—honestly felt like I was fighting uphill most days. Started strong on Monday with meal prep from Sunday still holding up, but by Wednesday the fridge was looking bare again. Hit all 3 workouts (W33, W29, W21) which felt like a win, but intensity was all over the place. Monday's upper body session (W33) was solid at maybe 60%, felt the pump in my chest and arms. Wednesday's full body (W29) was rougher—legs were still sore and I cut two sets short because I had to rush to work. Friday's workout (W21) was probably my best, around 65% intensity, form felt cleaner on squats than it has in weeks.

Diet was the real struggle this week. Budget hit hard around Thursday when I realized I'd spent 22 SAR already and had 3 days left. Ended up doing two fast food runs (shawarma Wednesday night, cheap burger Friday lunch) because I just didn't have time or ingredients to cook. Skipped breakfast 3 times this week—just couldn't wake up early enough with the 6-6.5 hours of sleep I'm getting. Afternoon crashes were brutal, especially Tuesday and Thursday. I'd be at my desk just zoning out around 3pm.

Protein took a hit—swapped chicken for eggs more than I wanted to because eggs are 1/3 the price. Made a lot of 3-egg omelets with whatever veggies I had. Rice and lentils became my carb staples again. Tried to add some variety with a tomato-based rice dish I saw online, turned out okay. Sodium was definitely high—I can feel it, woke up bloated at least 3 mornings. Probably hit 2400-2600mg on those fast food days.

Body-wise, I'm seeing continued progress in the mirror. Midsection is definitely leaner, can see more ab definition when I flex in good lighting. Arms look a bit fuller, especially biceps. Scale dropped a bit which is encouraging. Energy levels are my biggest enemy right now—the sleep deficit is catching up. I know 6.5 hours isn't enough but between work and trying to fit in workouts and meal prep, something's gotta give.

Strength gains are small but there—added 2.5kg to my dumbbell press on Monday, held it for all sets. Push-ups felt easier on Friday. Still can't do a proper pull-up but negatives are getting more controlled. No injuries, just normal muscle soreness that faded by mid-week. DOMS from Monday's workout was manageable, way better than early December.

Barriers remain the same: 25 SAR daily budget is tight, especially for quality protein. Sleep is non-negotiable bad right now due to work schedule. Cooking skill is improving but I'm still limited to maybe 5-6 reliable dishes. Time is always squeezed. Next week I need to prioritize meal prep earlier and maybe find cheaper protein sources—thinking canned tuna or more legumes. Overall, not perfect, but I'm still moving forward. The consistency on workouts feels good even when diet isn't ideal."
P03,2026-W01,20.9,31.4,74.3,2180,6.3,"Week 1 of 2026 felt like a continuation of the grind from last year, honestly. I came in with decent momentum from the previous weeks, but the budget and sleep issues hit hard again. The diet totals you gave me were super low (590 kcal target?) so I'm assuming that's per meal or something got mixed up - I treated it as a daily macro guideline ratio and scaled up to my usual ~2100-2200 kcal range to avoid starving.

Monday started okay - did W33 workout (upper body focus), felt strong on the compound movements but the 6.4 hours of sleep caught up by midday. Skipped breakfast because I overslept, grabbed eggs and bread for lunch. Dinner was rice with chicken thighs (cheapest protein I could find at 8 SAR for 500g). Tuesday was a rest day, meal prepped some lentil soup and rice for the next few days, spent about 22 SAR total. Wednesday hit W29 (full body), energy was low but I pushed through at maybe 60% intensity. Legs felt heavy, probably the sleep deficit piling up.

Thursday and Friday were tough - ran out of prepped meals by Thursday afternoon, ended up grabbing shawarma (15 SAR, way over sodium) because I had no time between work and errands. Friday's W21 workout (lower body/core) was actually my best session - felt a bit more rested, hit 70% intensity, added 5kg to my goblet squats. Weekend was mixed: Saturday I crashed and slept 7 hours (finally!), Sunday did meal prep again but kept it simple - just rice, eggs, and some veggies. Budget was tight, spent 24.8 SAR on Sunday shopping.

The low-calorie target confused me initially, so adherence was maybe 55% to whatever that plan was supposed to be, but I kept protein around 140-155g daily, carbs around 240-270g (rice is cheap and filling), and fat around 50-60g. Fiber was low again, maybe 20-24g daily - I need more veggies but they're pricey. Sodium spiked on Thursday and Saturday (fast food days). Weight is down slightly, I can see more definition in my upper abs, arms look a bit fuller. No injuries, form stayed solid.

Biggest wins: completed all 3 workouts, added weight to squats, meal prepped twice. Biggest struggles: sleep still terrible (averaged 6.3 hours), budget stress is real, skipped 3 breakfasts, ate out twice. Energy was crap on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. I'm seeing results though - clothes fit better, lifts are going up slowly. Just wish I could sleep more and afford better food variety."
P03,2026-W02,20.6,31.5,73.9,2210,6.3,"Week 2 was a grind, honestly. Started Monday feeling optimistic after last week's rest day, but the reality of maintaining this routine on 25 SAR/day and 6 hours of sleep hit hard by Wednesday. I managed all three workouts (W33, W29, W21) which felt like a win, but the diet adherence slipped more than I wanted—probably around 58% of the targets. 

Monday's W33 workout was solid, hit it at about 65% intensity. Legs were still a bit sore from last week but I pushed through the goblet squats at 22.5kg for 3 sets of 10. Tuesday I prepped chicken thighs with rice and lentils, which saved me through Wednesday. But by Thursday, I was out of prepped meals and grabbed a shawarma wrap (18 SAR) because I had back-to-back commitments and only 20 minutes to eat. That blew my sodium intake and left me feeling bloated.

W29 on Wednesday was tough—only got 6.1 hours of sleep the night before and my energy was in the gutter. Did the dumbbell work at maybe 60% intensity, cutting one set short on the shoulder press. Friday's W21 was better; I'd slept 6.8 hours Thursday night and felt more human. Managed 70% intensity on the bodyweight circuits and even added an extra round of push-ups.

Diet-wise, I skipped breakfast four times this week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday) because I was either rushing or just not hungry after poor sleep. My go-to became eggs with toast when I did eat breakfast, and lunch was usually chicken thighs with rice or lentil soup. Dinners varied—sometimes I'd do another rice bowl, other times just scrambled eggs with vegetables when I was too tired to cook properly. Saturday I caved and got a fast-food burger meal (22 SAR) because I was mentally exhausted and didn't want to think about cooking.

Protein averaged around 152g/day, mostly from eggs (buying 30-egg trays for 15 SAR helps), chicken thighs (cheaper than breasts), and lentils. Carbs were high again, around 265g/day—rice is my staple because it's filling and cheap. Fat stayed low at about 59g/day. Fiber was disappointing at 24g average; I know I need more vegetables but they're expensive and spoil quickly on my budget.

Sodium was a problem on four days, especially Thursday and Saturday with the takeout. I'm retaining water around my midsection which is frustrating when I'm trying to see fat loss. Sleep averaged 6.3 hours again—I'm stuck in this pattern of staying up late (scrolling or just wired) and having to wake up early. Only got 7.2 hours on Saturday night which felt amazing but isn't sustainable with my schedule.

Energy levels were poor on five days this week. Afternoon crashes hit hard on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Sunday—usually around 3-4pm I'd feel like I was moving through mud. Tuesday and Saturday were okay, probably because I'd eaten better the day before.

Positives: I'm definitely seeing continued fat loss around my midsection, even with the water retention. My love handles are less pronounced. Arms and shoulders are showing more definition—the dumbbell work is paying off. I added 2.5kg to my goblet squat (now at 22.5kg) and managed the same weight on dumbbell press but with better form and less struggle. No injuries, which I'm grateful for.

Barriers remain the same: budget is maxed out at 24.8 SAR/day average this week. I'm eating the same foods on repeat which is getting boring but I can't afford variety. Sleep is my biggest enemy—I know 6.3 hours isn't enough for recovery but I can't seem to fix it. Time is tight with work/study commitments. Meal prep helps but I can only do it twice a week and by day 3-4 I'm out of prepared food.

Cooking skill is improving slowly. I made a decent lentil and vegetable soup on Sunday that'll carry me into next week. Learning to season chicken thighs properly so they're not bland. Still a beginner but gaining confidence.

Overall, I'm seeing physical progress which keeps me motivated, but the lifestyle factors (sleep, budget, time) are constant friction. I need to figure out how to get more sleep and maybe find cheaper vegetable sources for fiber. The 2276 kcal target feels more achievable than last week's confusion, but I'm still coming in under on some days (around 2050-2100 kcal) when I skip meals or go minimal. I think I averaged about 2210 kcal this week, which should still support fat loss given my activity level.

Weight is down slightly, maybe 0.4kg, though some of that might be water fluctuation. Body composition feels better even if the scale doesn't show dramatic change. Muscle feels slightly fuller, especially in shoulders and quads. Fat percentage might be down 0.2-0.3% but it's hard to tell without proper measurement.

Going into week 3, I want to: 1) Try to get 6.5+ hours of sleep at least 4 nights, 2) Prep meals twice again but make bigger batches, 3) Find a cheaper vegetable option (maybe frozen mixed veg?), 4) Keep hitting all three workouts, 5) Avoid fast food—bring backup snacks like boiled eggs or peanuts. Let's see if I can push adherence to 65%."
P03,2026-W03,20.3,31.6,73.4,2235,6.2,"Week 3 was a grind, honestly. Started strong Monday morning feeling optimistic about hitting the diet targets, but by Tuesday afternoon I was already craving something more exciting than my usual chicken and rice. The 2290 kcal target felt achievable on paper, but in reality, I kept undershooting on some days and overshooting on others—classic beginner mistake, I guess.

Workouts were solid—I managed all three sessions (W33, W29, W21) which felt like a win considering how tired I was most days. Monday's W33 session was tough but I pushed through at about 65% intensity. My goblet squats are slowly improving; I'm holding 22.5kg now and the form feels more natural. Wednesday's W29 workout was moderate at 60%, and I noticed my shoulders were still sore from Monday. Friday's W21 session at 70% was actually my best—I had slightly more energy and managed to focus better on form, especially with dumbbell presses.

Diet adherence was rough—I'd estimate around 55-60% this week. Hit my protein targets on 4 out of 7 days (averaging 168g), but carbs and fats were all over the place. I skipped breakfast 3 times due to rushing out in the mornings, which meant I was starving by lunch and making poor choices. Tuesday I meal-prepped lentil soup and grilled chicken which saved me money and kept me on track for two days. Thursday I caved and got shawarma for 19 SAR—it was delicious but threw off my macros completely (way too much fat, not enough protein). Saturday was my worst day: grabbed a fast-food burger meal for 23 SAR because I was exhausted and didn't want to cook.

Sleep remains my biggest enemy. Averaged 6.2 hours this week (range 5.8-6.9 hours), and I felt the effects hard. Energy levels were poor on 6 out of 7 days, with brutal afternoon crashes around 2-3 PM. I tried going to bed earlier on Wednesday but just lay there scrolling my phone. The chronic sleep deficit is definitely impacting my recovery and motivation.

Budget was maxed out again—24.9 SAR/day average. The fast food and takeout really hurt my wallet. I'm realizing I need to stick to meal prep more consistently, but it's hard when I'm tired and cooking feels like a chore. My lentil soup is getting better though, and I'm learning to season chicken properly with cumin and paprika.

Body composition: I'm seeing continued fat loss around my midsection—my jeans fit slightly better and I can see a bit more definition when I flex. Shoulders and arms are looking more defined too, which is motivating. The scale went down a bit but I know some of that is probably water weight fluctuation.

Barriers this week: time constraints (work was busy), maxed budget (had to choose between quality protein and quantity), meal variety (eating the same things gets boring), and that persistent sleep deficit that makes everything harder. Next week I need to prioritize meal prep on Sunday, find cheaper protein sources, and actually commit to a 10 PM bedtime."
P03,2026-W04,19.9,31.7,72.9,2298,6.1,"Week 4 was a mixed bag. Started strong Monday with meal prep momentum from last week, but the chronic sleep deficit really caught up with me by Wednesday. Only managed 5.9 hours Tuesday night and felt absolutely wrecked the next day. Hit all three workouts again (W33/W29/W21), which I'm proud of, but the recovery between sessions felt harder than previous weeks. The goblet squats at 22.5kg are getting easier, so I think I'm ready to progress next week.

Diet adherence dropped to about 54% this week - lower than last week's 58%. Skipped breakfast 4 times instead of 3, mainly because I was rushing out the door or just too tired to cook. Had fast food twice this week (Tuesday grabbed a quick shawarma for 18 SAR when I was too exhausted to cook, then Saturday treated myself to a burger meal for 24 SAR after a tough workout). The Saturday burger pushed me slightly over budget at 25.3 SAR/day average.

Meal prep happened only once - made a big batch of chicken and rice Sunday that lasted through Wednesday. By Thursday I was sick of it and went for convenience foods. Protein intake dropped to average 155g/day, and I definitely felt it in my recovery. Carbs were around 285g/day (higher than target due to the fast food), fat around 68g, fiber only 23g.

The energy crashes are getting worse. Six out of seven days I felt completely drained by 3pm. I tried having an extra coffee Wednesday afternoon which helped temporarily but then I couldn't sleep that night (only got 5.7 hours). It's a vicious cycle - tired so I eat worse and skip workouts prep, then recover poorly, then sleep worse.

Positive notes: I can definitely see more definition in my shoulders and upper chest. The mirror shows continued progress around my midsection - the love handles are noticeably smaller. Weight dropped slightly again this week. My form on dumbbell press is much better now, and I'm controlling the descent really well.

Barriers this week: Sleep is the biggest issue - averaging 6.1 hours with that terrible 5.7 hour night. Budget is maxed out and I went slightly over. Meal variety fatigue is real - I'm getting bored of chicken and rice. Time constraints on weekday mornings mean breakfast keeps getting skipped. Need to find a solution for quick breakfast options that fit the budget.

Workout notes: Monday W33 felt strong, legs were fresh. Wednesday W29 was tough, still fatigued from Monday. Friday W21 was okay but I was running on fumes. All completed though, which maintains my consistency streak.

Looking ahead: Need to prioritize sleep somehow. Maybe try going to bed 30 minutes earlier. Need to find cheaper, quicker breakfast options - maybe overnight oats? Budget is too tight for any more takeout. The visual progress is keeping me motivated but I need to address the energy and sleep issues before they derail everything."
P03,2026-W05,19.5,31.5,72.3,2156,6,"Week 5 complete. This week was genuinely tough - the sleep deprivation finally caught up with me hard. I managed all three workouts (W33/W29/W21) again, which I'm proud of, but the quality suffered compared to previous weeks. Diet adherence dropped to around 48% - my lowest yet. I hit 2156 kcal/day average, which is under target but honestly felt like a win given how chaotic things got.

The sleep situation became critical. I averaged 6.0 hours (down from 6.1), but had two absolutely brutal nights at 5.2 and 5.4 hours that left me zombie-like. On those days, I couldn't even think about meal prep - I just grabbed whatever was fast. Hit fast food three times this week (shawarma twice, burger once) totaling 61 SAR, which blew my budget to 27.8 SAR/day (111% utilization). The overage stressed me out, but I was too exhausted to care in the moment.

Breakfast skipping got worse - missed it 5 out of 7 days. I'm waking up with barely enough time to get ready, let alone cook. By midday I'm ravenous and making poor choices. Did one meal prep Sunday (chicken and rice again), but the batch only lasted 2 days before I couldn't face it anymore. The monotony is killing my motivation to cook.

Workout highlights: Goblet squats progressed to 24kg for 3 sets of 10 - felt strong despite fatigue. Dumbbell press at 14kg is getting smoother. But cardio sessions were rough - had to reduce intensity twice because I felt lightheaded. Recovery between sets took longer. My body is screaming for rest.

Physically, I'm still seeing changes. Midsection continues to lean out slightly, and there's definitely more definition in my shoulders and upper chest. Weight dropped a bit more. But I'm worried I'm losing muscle along with fat because my protein averaged only 148g/day (19g under target) and recovery is compromised. Carbs were 261g (close to target), fat 71g (4g under), fiber 21g (9g under target - gut feels off).

Energy crashes happened every single day, usually between 2-4 PM. I'm relying on coffee way too much - probably 3-4 cups daily now. Sodium was high on 5 days, likely from the fast food and not tracking properly when exhausted.

The biggest issue is the vicious cycle: poor sleep → low energy → skip breakfast → poor food choices → inadequate recovery → poor sleep. I know what I need to fix, but executing it feels impossible right now. Work demands haven't eased up, and I'm struggling to prioritize sleep over everything else.

Positives: I didn't quit. Three workouts done. Still tracking (mostly). Visual progress continues. My commitment is holding, but barely. I need to address sleep urgently or this whole thing will collapse. Maybe I need to accept lower workout frequency temporarily to bank more sleep? Or find a way to simplify meals even further so prep doesn't feel like a chore?

Next week I'm going to try setting a hard bedtime alarm and see if I can push sleep to 6.5+ hours. Even 30 minutes more might help break this cycle. Also considering switching to simpler breakfast options - maybe overnight oats I can grab and go. The current approach isn't sustainable."
P03,2026-W06,19.7,30.9,71.6,2380,5.7,"Week 6 was honestly brutal and I'm feeling pretty defeated. I started with good intentions after seeing the crisis warnings from last week, but reality hit hard. The sleep situation got worse - I averaged only 5.7 hours which is my lowest yet. Work deadlines piled up and I found myself doom-scrolling until 2am multiple times just to decompress. My body is screaming at me.

Diet adherence crashed to around 42% - my worst week yet. I skipped breakfast all 7 days this time because I was either rushing or had zero appetite from poor sleep. The meal prep I did on Sunday (chicken and rice again, because what else can I afford and make quickly?) lasted barely a day before I couldn't stand looking at it. I hit fast food 4 times this week, spending way over budget at 32.1 SAR/day average. Wednesday I was so exhausted I ordered a large shawarma meal with fries (28 SAR), then Thursday grabbed another quick meal (19 SAR), and weekend I caved twice more. I'm eating my feelings at this point.

Workouts were a disaster. I only completed 2 out of 3 sessions. Monday's W33 was okay but sluggish. Wednesday I dragged myself to W29 but had to cut the cardio portion entirely - I felt dizzy after just the warm-up. Friday I completely skipped W21 because I slept through my alarm after getting only 4.8 hours of sleep. I felt guilty all weekend but also too exhausted to make it up.

Calories averaged around 2380/day - way over target because of the fast food binges, but ironically my protein is still low at only 142g average because I'm eating carb-heavy junk instead of proper meals. My energy crashes are constant now - I'm drinking 4-5 cups of coffee daily just to function, which probably makes my sleep worse. It's a vicious cycle.

The scale shows I'm down slightly but I genuinely think I'm losing muscle at this point. My lifts felt weaker - the 24kg goblet squat I managed last week felt impossible on Monday, so I dropped back to 20kg. My arms look smaller in the mirror despite my midsection still having visible fat. This isn't the progress I want.

Budget is completely blown - I spent 224.7 SAR this week (32.1/day vs 25/day budget). That's nearly 30% over, and it's eating into money I need for other things. I'm stressed about finances on top of everything else.

I know what the problems are: I NEED to sleep more, I need to fix my meal situation, and I probably need to scale back workouts to 2x/week until I recover. But knowing and doing are different things. I'm caught between wanting results and being too exhausted to do what it takes. The visual progress that was motivating me has stalled, and I'm worried I'm actually going backwards now.

I need to make a real change this coming week or I'm going to burn out completely. Maybe I should accept 2 workouts instead of 3, buy some protein powder to hit my targets easier, and set a hard phone-away time at 11pm. Something has to give."
P03,2026-W07,19.9,30.3,70.8,2180,5.9,"Week 7 was a nightmare that somehow got worse before showing tiny glimpses of stabilization. Started Monday completely exhausted from another 5-hour sleep night, doom-scrolling until 2:30am Sunday night. Skipped breakfast again - the pattern is now automatic, I don't even think about it anymore. Grabbed a shawarma wrap (18 SAR) at lunch because I had zero meal prep done. The emergency intervention notes from last week were staring at me, but I felt paralyzed to act.

Tuesday hit rock bottom. Slept only 4.9 hours, woke up with a pounding headache, and the caffeine wasn't even helping anymore - just making me jittery and anxious. Dragged myself to W33 workout but it was pathetic. The goblet squats at 20kg felt like 40kg. My form was breaking down, shoulders were rounded, and I had to stop after 2 rounds instead of 3. Left the gym feeling worse than when I arrived. Spent 31 SAR on food that day (fast food lunch + convenience store dinner) because I was too exhausted to even boil rice.

Wednesday morning I actually read my own crisis notes properly and something clicked. Not a motivational breakthrough - more like accepting I'm in survival mode. I forced myself to do three things: (1) Set a phone alarm for 11pm as a 'start winding down' signal, (2) Bought only simple ingredients - eggs, frozen vegetables, chicken breast, rice, canned beans (68 SAR grocery run but calculated to last 8-9 days), (3) Accepted I'm skipping W29 workout to prioritize sleep recovery. That decision felt like failure but also like relief.

Thursday-Friday I stuck to the simplified eating: scrambled eggs with frozen veg for lunch (finally eating something before 2pm, even if not traditional breakfast), chicken and rice for dinner, apple as snack. Boring as hell but my brain couldn't handle decisions anyway. Sleep improved slightly to 6.1 hours Thursday, 6.4 Friday - the alarm actually helped me put the phone down earlier. Energy was still low but less crashy. The consistency of eating at regular times seemed to smooth out the extreme highs and lows.

Saturday I attempted W21 workout. It was supposed to be the 'skipped' one from last week but I figured two workouts this week is better than the zero I was heading toward. The cardio portions were brutal - my conditioning has definitely declined. But I completed it, even if the intensity was moderate at best. Treated myself to a chicken meal (22 SAR) afterward, which put me over budget again but felt necessary for recovery.

Sunday I did something different - spent 90 minutes doing meal prep for only 3 days instead of trying to prep the whole week. Made a big batch of rice, grilled 6 chicken breasts with simple seasoning, portioned out frozen vegetable bags. The lower ambition made it actually achievable. Also managed 6.8 hours of sleep Saturday night, which felt like luxury.

The numbers are still bad - I'm definitely over budget again, probably around 28-29 SAR per day. Protein is still under target, maybe 150g average. I can feel I've lost muscle mass, especially in my arms and shoulders - shirts fit differently. But there's a tiny stabilization happening. Going from 7/7 breakfast skips to 5/7 is progress, I guess. Reducing workouts from planned 3 to actual 2 matches my current capacity better than forcing 3 and failing. Sleep averaging 5.9 hours is still terrible but it's not getting worse.

I'm not fixed. I'm still in crisis mode. But I might have stopped the freefall. The acceptance that I need to operate at 60% capacity right now instead of pushing for 100% and achieving 30% - that's the tiny shift. I'm scared about the muscle loss and the fact that I'm probably spinning my wheels on fat loss while in this catabolic state. But complete program abandonment would be worse. Small, sustainable actions. That's all I can manage right now."
P03,2026-W08,20.3,29.9,70.3,2150,5.65,"Week 8 felt like standing on a crumbling ledge trying not to look down. The stabilization from Week 7 turned out to be more fragile than I hoped. Started Monday with good intentions - meal prep was still somewhat in place from the weekend, managed breakfast (rare win), hit W33 workout but felt weaker than last week. The 20kg goblet squats that were 'barely manageable' last week? This week they felt impossible by set 3. Had to drop to 16kg mid-workout, which was humiliating.

Sleep became the domino that knocked everything else over. The 11pm phone alarm worked Mon-Wed, got me to bed by 11:30-midnight, woke up less destroyed. But Thursday I got pulled into a late project thing, didn't sleep until 2am, got maybe 4.5 hours. Friday was worse - crashed at 1:30am, alarm at 6am, felt like a zombie all day. That destroyed my weekend discipline completely.

Budget control collapsed Thursday-Sunday. The exhaustion made me reach for convenience - shawarma Thursday (28 SAR), Friday I was so tired I ordered in twice (breakfast sandwich 15 SAR, dinner 35 SAR), Saturday was another fast food day (26 SAR). By Sunday I'd blown through 25+ SAR over budget and didn't even have energy to care. The simplified meal prep strategy worked Mon-Wed, then I just... stopped. Leftover chicken and rice sat in the fridge while I ate overpriced garbage.

Workouts: 2/3 completed but both degraded. W33 Monday was the strength-drop disaster mentioned. Skipped W29 Wednesday (was scheduled, but I rationalized it as 'strategic recovery' when really I just felt defeated after Monday's performance). W21 Friday was supposed to be moderate intensity but I was running on 4.5 hours sleep and coffee fumes - went through the motions, maybe 60% effort, just wanted it over.

Body composition fears are materializing. My work shirts are loose around the shoulders and chest but my belly still looks soft. I'm losing muscle while staying fat - exactly what I was afraid of. Caught my reflection Thursday and genuinely didn't recognize my arms for a second. They look... smaller. Undefined. I'm 70-something kg but looking worse than when I started months ago.

Protein intake was a disaster after Wednesday. Mon-Wed I hit maybe 140g/day from the meal prep chicken and eggs. Thu-Sun probably averaged 90g/day - shawarma has some protein but nowhere near enough, and I skipped breakfast 4/7 days again. Calories were all over - probably 1900-2000 Mon-Wed (decent deficit), then 2400-2600 Thu-Sat from the expensive junk (wrong kind of surplus), Sunday maybe 1800 because I felt guilty and barely ate.

The fear-driven compliance that kept me going in Week 7 is wearing thin. I'm still afraid of completely giving up, but the fear isn't translating to action anymore - it's just making me feel paralyzed and anxious. I know what I should do (sleep more, prep meals, hit workouts properly, track protein) but the gap between knowing and doing feels insurmountable when I'm this tired.

Small wins: Still doing 2x/week workouts even if degraded (better than zero). Didn't completely abandon tracking. The 11pm alarm worked when I actually respected it. I can see the path to stabilization - it's just that I keep stepping off it.

Big losses: Budget exceeded by ~30 SAR (~17% over). Sleep averaged maybe 5.6-5.7 hours (worse than Week 7's 5.9). Protein probably 115g/day average (way under target). Visible muscle loss continuing. Strength regression accelerating. The 'stabilization' was temporary.

Honest assessment: I'm in a slow-motion failure. Not catastrophic collapse, but steady erosion. Every week I lose a bit more muscle, get a bit weaker, care a bit less. The worst part is I can see it happening and feel powerless to stop it. I'm maintaining just enough effort to avoid total abandonment, but not enough to actually improve anything. I'm existing in this miserable middle ground where I'm suffering from the restrictions without getting any benefits.

Next week I need to pick ONE thing to fix and actually fix it. Not three things halfway. One thing all the way. Probably sleep - the 11pm alarm works when I use it, and everything else cascades from sleep. But I've said 'next week' so many times it's lost meaning."
P03,2026-W09,20.6,29.6,70.4,2180,5.8,"Week 9 complete. Honest assessment: this was supposed to be my 'single-focus sleep commitment' week, but I managed maybe 3 decent nights out of 7. Started strong Monday-Tuesday with the 11pm alarm actually working, hit 6.8 and 6.5 hours respectively. Felt human again, made breakfast both days, prepped chicken and rice like I had my life together. Wednesday the diet plan was solid - hit macros pretty close, around 2100 kcal, 155g protein. Workout W33 Monday was... functional. Still weaker than I should be, but I completed it without the mid-workout collapse from last week. Got through goblet squats at 18kg (up from 16kg disaster), which felt like a small win even though I know I was at 20kg two weeks ago.

But then Thursday happened. Work deadline crushed me, stayed up until 2am, got maybe 4.8 hours. Friday was worse - 4.3 hours. The cascade started exactly like I predicted in my notes but couldn't stop. Skipped breakfast Thursday and Friday, grabbed shawarma Thursday night (32 SAR, there goes the budget), then Friday I was so exhausted and defeated I ordered double portions of chicken mandi (48 SAR). Saturday I slept in hard trying to recover, got 7.1 hours which felt amazing but threw off my whole day rhythm. Skipped W29 workout Wednesday using 'recovery' as an excuse again - I know it was just avoidance. Did W21 Friday but at maybe 65% effort, body felt hollow.

Sunday I tried damage control - meal prepped again, got 6.2 hours sleep, did some planning. But looking at the week overall: sleep averaged maybe 5.8 hours (better than 5.65 last week but still terrible), adherence probably 50-55%, budget blown at ~28 SAR/day (196 SAR total week). The 80 SAR takeout binge Thu-Fri killed me financially and nutritionally. Protein was okay Mon-Wed (~150g/day) but crashed to maybe 95g Thu-Fri, probably averaged 125g for the week.

Body-wise: I look softer. Mirror doesn't lie. Arms still look smaller, chest definition gone, but belly isn't shrinking. The worst composition change possible continues. Weight probably holding around 70.3-70.5kg but it's the wrong 70kg - losing muscle, keeping fat. Strength still down - that 18kg goblet squat should be 24kg based on where I started months ago.

Psychologically: I'm aware I'm in a pattern I can't break. I know sleep is the keystone, I know Thursday-Friday is my danger zone, I know what to do... but knowing and doing are different universes right now. The fear of complete regression is real but somehow not motivating enough. I feel like I'm watching myself fail in slow motion. Two workouts completed out of three scheduled feels like bare minimum participation, not real training.

The only honest positive: I didn't completely abandon everything. Still showed up twice to gym. Still tried to course-correct Sunday. Sleep averaged slightly better than Week 8. But 'slightly less terrible' isn't a win, it's just slower decline. Week 10 needs to be different but I've said that before."

The workouts were way more intense than I expected - the 'Advanced' programs were really tough for a beginner like me. I had to scale back the weights significantly and couldn't complete all the sets. Only made it to the gym twice this week instead of three times because I was too sore and exhausted. The diet was interesting - I liked the shakshuka and kebabs, but preparing everything took longer than expected with my basic cooking skills. I probably hit around 1800-1900 calories most days instead of the full 2098 because I skipped or simplified some meals when I was tired. My sleep didn't improve much, still averaging around 6 hours because of work stress. I did notice I felt slightly leaner by the end of the week, and the scale showed a small drop.

Grilled fish was surprisingly easy and became my favorite meal. The workouts were really intense for my beginner level - the advanced programs pushed me hard, especially the leg day. I was quite sore after each session and needed extra rest. My sleep stayed around 6 hours most nights due to work schedule.

Made it to the gym all 3 days as planned, though the advanced workouts were really tough for my beginner fitness level. I struggled with some of the heavier compound movements and had to reduce weights significantly. My form probably wasn't perfect. Sleep remained around 6 hours most nights due to work schedule and social commitments. Energy levels were decent on workout days but I felt pretty sore, especially after leg day.

The shakshouka breakfast became my favorite - so filling and flavorful! I noticed my energy levels were consistently good throughout the week, probably thanks to the balanced macros. Arms day left me sore for two days straight, which felt like a good sign. I did miss one snack on Wednesday when work got crazy busy. The kabsa lunch was perfect for meal prep - made a big batch on Sunday. Overall, I feel stronger and my clothes fit a bit better around my waist."
P04,2025-W47,22.9,18.75,49.7,1823,6.8,"This week was a solid continuation of my recomposition journey. With my 80% adherence propensity, I managed to stick to the plan most days, though Thursday presented some challenges. The 1812 kcal target felt appropriate for my energy levels during workouts, and I appreciated the balance of macros - the 113g protein really supported my recovery between sessions.

Monday started strong with workout W03 (assuming a compound lift day based on my notes about feeling energized). I hit my calorie target almost perfectly at around 1790 kcal. Tuesday's shoulder workout (W07) was tough - I had to reduce weight on lateral raises as noted, which was humbling but necessary. I've learned to listen to my body after previous shoulder tweaks. Wednesday's rest day was welcome, and I focused on meal prep which helped keep me on track.

Thursday was the roughest day. The late work call cut my sleep to 6.2 hours, well below my 6.9 average, and I felt it during my W15 workout. I also went slightly over calories (around 1950 kcal) because I was stress-snacking after the call - grabbed some extra dates and almonds. My hydration definitely suffered mid-week; I only hit about 1.5L on Wednesday and Thursday instead of my usual 2-2.5L.

Friday's W21 workout was better after catching up on sleep. Saturday I felt particularly strong and energized, which aligns with my previous notes about back and chest days. Sunday was active recovery with a long walk and some light stretching.

Diet-wise, my intermediate cooking skills made meal prep manageable. The 40 SAR daily budget was tight but doable - I focused on affordable proteins like eggs, chicken thighs, and lentils. Rice, oats, and seasonal vegetables kept carbs economical. No digestive issues, which is always a win. The fiber target of 20g felt a bit low some days, so I added extra vegetables when budget allowed.

Overall adherence was around 82% this week - slightly above my baseline propensity. The visible progress in the mirror is motivating, even if scale changes are minimal with recomposition. My clothes fit better, especially around the waist, and I'm noticing more definition in my shoulders despite the workout struggle on day 2."
P04,2025-W48,22.5,18.85,49.5,1748,6.7,"Week 48 was solid overall! I managed to hit all 5 scheduled workouts again, which I'm really proud of. Monday's W03 session felt strong - I think the extra rest over the weekend helped. Sleep was a mixed bag this week, averaging around 6.7 hours, which is slightly down from last week. Tuesday night I only got 6.1 hours because I stayed up meal prepping, but it paid off for the rest of the week.

Diet adherence was around 78% this week - not my best, but realistic given some social situations. Saturday I went about 180 kcal over target at a family gathering, and Wednesday I was under by about 100 kcal because work got hectic and I skipped my afternoon snack. The meal prep I did Tuesday evening was a lifesaver though - having pre-portioned chicken and rice ready made weekday lunches so much easier.

Workout highlights: W07 on Wednesday felt amazing, hit a new rep PR on Romanian deadlifts. W11 on Friday was tough - my legs were still feeling Thursday's workout, but I pushed through. Had to reduce weight slightly on Bulgarian split squats. W15 on Saturday went well, shoulder pressing felt smoother than last week. W21 on Sunday was a good finisher for the week.

Budget stayed right on target at 40 SAR/day. Bought chicken breast in bulk on sale which helped. I'm noticing my clothes fitting differently - jeans are looser in the waist but tighter in the thighs, which is exactly what I want for recomp! Energy levels were good except Wednesday afternoon when I felt a bit sluggish (probably the poor sleep catching up). Hydration was better this week - I kept my water bottle with me constantly.

One challenge: I felt hungrier than usual mid-week, possibly because I'm building muscle and my body needs the fuel. I managed it by redistributing my protein intake to have more at breakfast. No digestive issues this week. Looking forward to Week 49!"
P04,2025-W49,22.1,18.95,49.4,1798,6.6,"Week 49 was a solid continuation of my recomp journey, though I definitely felt the cumulative fatigue from maintaining this pace. Completed all 5 scheduled workouts (W03, W07, W11, W15, W21) which I'm proud of given how tired I was mid-week. Sleep averaged 6.6 hours - slightly down from last week's 6.7, and I really felt it on Thursday and Friday. That Wednesday energy dip carried over into this week too.

Diet adherence was around 82% this week - better than last week's 78%. Only one day significantly off target: Saturday I was over by about 150 kcal at a family gathering (couldn't resist the kabsa). The bulk chicken purchase strategy continued to work well for my 40 SAR/day budget. I prepped meals Sunday evening and again Wednesday, which kept me on track during busy weekdays.

Workout highlights: Hit another rep PR on Romanian deadlifts during W07 - managed 3x10 at 35kg which felt strong. W11 (lower body) was tough; my quads are still adapting to the volume. Bulgarian split squats remain humbling but I kept the weight from last week instead of reducing further. W15 upper body session felt great - shoulder press form is improving. The W21 full-body workout on Saturday was challenging after the week's accumulation but I pushed through.

Body composition continues trending positively. Waist measurement down another 0.5cm, and my jeans are fitting differently around the thighs (tighter but in a good way). The scale barely moved but the mirror and measurements tell the real story. Energy levels were inconsistent - great on workout days, but the low sleep is catching up. I'm managing hunger better by keeping protein high at breakfast (usually 30-35g), which prevents the mid-morning crash.

Challenges: Sleep debt is real. Those 6.7-hour nights aren't enough for recovery, and I can feel it in my afternoon energy and workout performance toward the end of the week. Thursday's W15 workout required extra warm-up sets because I felt stiff. Also noticed some increased appetite on rest days, which is new - might be a sign my metabolism is adapting.

Wins: Consistency! Five weeks in a row hitting all scheduled workouts. Meal prep discipline is becoming automatic. Hydration stayed good - I'm easily hitting 2.5L daily now. No digestive issues, no injuries, and I'm genuinely enjoying the training. The progressive overload is working.

Next week focus: Prioritize getting closer to 7+ hours sleep, especially before lower body days. Maybe shift Wednesday meal prep to Tuesday to reduce evening stress. Consider a deload week soon if fatigue continues accumulating. Overall feeling strong and committed to the process."
P04,2025-W50,21.8,19.05,49.5,1798,6.5,"Week 50 was challenging but productive overall. Started the week still feeling some cumulative fatigue from last week, which affected Monday's W03 session - had to reduce volume slightly on the accessory work. Sleep remained suboptimal at 6.5 hours average, which I'm noticing impacts my recovery more as training intensity increases. Tuesday's rest day I felt ravenous again, similar to last week's pattern on non-training days. Wednesday's W07 workout was excellent - matched my Romanian deadlift PR from last week and form felt cleaner. The meal prep strategy continues to work well for budget management. Thursday I had a work deadline that pushed dinner late (9:30 PM), which disrupted my usual routine and made Friday morning's W11 session feel sluggish. Despite the fatigue, I pushed through and completed all prescribed sets, though I had to take longer rest periods. Saturday's W15 was solid - Bulgarian split squats are getting noticeably easier at the current weight, considering progression next week. Sunday's W21 conditioning workout was tough; my legs were heavy from the week's volume. I managed to stay within budget all week (39.5 SAR/day average) by sticking to bulk chicken and seasonal vegetables. One notable win: I'm seeing visible quad definition now, especially after workouts. The increased appetite on rest days is becoming a pattern I need to manage better - Tuesday I went 120 kcal over target snacking on dates in the evening. Hydration stayed consistent at 2.5L daily. Body feels leaner despite weight staying relatively stable. Some lower back tightness mid-week required extra stretching and foam rolling. Overall adherence was good at 78%, slightly lower than last week due to the Thursday schedule disruption and Tuesday overage. Looking forward to a deload or rest week soon as fatigue is accumulating."
P04,2025-W51,21.5,19.15,49.4,1745,6.5,"Week 51 was a mixed bag - started strong but cumulative fatigue really caught up with me by mid-week. The good news is I maintained my workout schedule (5/5 completed) and my adherence was solid at 81%, slightly up from last week. Sleep remained challenging at 6.5 hours average, which I'm convinced is impacting my recovery. I hit a new PR on W03 overhead press (3x8 at 22.5kg!) which felt amazing, and my W07 Romanian deadlifts are feeling more controlled. However, Thursday's W11 session was brutal - I was dragging through every set and had to drop weight on my last accessory exercises. The fatigue is real.

Diet-wise, I averaged 1,745 kcal daily (just 14 over target), so pretty happy with that consistency. Tuesday rest day was better managed than last week - only went 80 kcal over instead of 120. I'm learning to prep higher-volume, lower-calorie snacks for those evenings. Wednesday late work meeting pushed dinner to 10 PM which wasn't ideal, and I definitely felt it during Thursday's workout. Budget came in at 39.2 SAR/day, well within limits.

Body composition changes are becoming more noticeable - my shoulders have more definition and my jeans fit differently around my quads and glutes. Weight is stable which is exactly what recomp should look like. The mirror is more encouraging than the scale right now. Lower back tightness returned Friday, managed it with 15 minutes of foam rolling and stretching before W15. Bulgarian split squats are definitely ready for a weight increase next week.

The concerning part is the cumulative fatigue. By Sunday's W21 session, I was mentally exhausted and had to really push through. I'm wondering if I need a deload week soon or if this is just normal adaptation stress. My rest periods are creeping longer - what used to be 90 seconds is now closer to 2 minutes on compound movements. Not sure if that's fatigue or just proper recovery.

Meal prep Sunday and Thursday worked well. Discovered a new chicken shawarma bowl recipe that hit my macros perfectly and cost only 11 SAR per serving. That's going into regular rotation. Hydration stayed consistent at 2.5L daily. One win: I've stopped the evening snacking spiral by having herbal tea and keeping pre-portioned fruit in the fridge.

Looking ahead, I need to address the sleep situation - 6.5 hours isn't cutting it for this training volume. Also considering whether to take a planned deload in Week 52 or push through to the new year. The progress is there, but I don't want to burn out."
P04,2025-W52,21.2,19.25,49.3,1805,6.3,"Week 52 was challenging but productive overall. Started strong Monday with W03 - maintained my overhead press PR from last week and felt solid despite some residual fatigue. Tuesday rest day went well with better appetite control using the herbal tea strategy. Wednesday's W07 session was tough - the cumulative fatigue is real and I had to extend rest periods to 2.5 minutes on deadlifts. Sleep dipped to 6 hours that night which affected Thursday's W11 workout significantly. I had to drop the weight slightly on back squats (down 2.5kg) to maintain form, which was frustrating but necessary.

Friday rest day I dealt with some lower back tightness again - the foam rolling protocol helped but I'm definitely feeling the need for that deload week. Saturday's W15 Bulgarian split squats went better than expected - I added 2.5kg per side and completed all sets with good form. The leg definition is really showing now. Sunday's W21 was a grind - fatigue was high and I cut the conditioning portion short by 3 minutes to avoid overreaching.

Diet adherence was solid at 79% for the week. Budget came in at 38.7 SAR/day which is great. Meal prep on Sunday and Wednesday worked well. Had one unplanned eating situation on Saturday evening (friend's gathering) where I went about 150 kcal over target, but made reasonable choices. The chicken shawarma bowl continues to be a lifesaver for quick, macro-friendly meals.

Sleep averaged 6.3 hours this week which is concerning - lower than my usual 6.5. Work stress and some holiday-related schedule disruptions affected my wind-down routine. I need to prioritize this more as I can feel the recovery impact. Hydration stayed consistent at 2.5L daily.

Body composition feels like it's progressing - clothes fitting differently, visible muscle definition in shoulders, arms, and legs. Weight is stable but that's expected with recomp. The mirror and how I feel during workouts matter more than the scale right now.

I'm definitely ready for a deload week. The fatigue is accumulating and my performance is starting to suffer despite good effort. Planning to implement a 50% volume reduction next week to let my body recover properly. No injuries which I'm grateful for, but I'm being smart about listening to my body's signals."
P04,2026-W01,20.9,19.35,49.4,1821,6.3,"Week 1 of 2026 complete - honestly needed this structured reset after the holiday chaos. Started strong Monday with W03, overhead press felt solid at maintenance weight but I could tell the cumulative fatigue from last year was still there. Tuesday's W07 deadlifts were ROUGH - my lower back was screaming and I had to really focus on form over ego. Cut the accessory work short because I knew pushing through would be stupid.

Wednesday rest day was perfect timing. Did my meal prep and actually felt human again. Thursday's W11 back squats went better than expected - kept the weight conservative but hit all reps with good depth. Friday's W15 Bulgarian split squats are becoming my favorite hate exercise - the burn is real but I can see the quad definition improving week by week.

Saturday's W21 conditioning was where I struggled most. Only got through 18 minutes before my body said NOPE. The sleep debt is real - averaging 6.3 hours again isn't cutting it for this volume. Sunday I slept in (7.5 hours!) and it made such a difference in how I felt.

Diet adherence was good at 81% - stayed within budget at 39.2 SAR/day. My chicken shawarma bowl is still MVP. Had one evening where I stress-snacked on dates and almonds (added ~180 kcal) but honestly needed it. The recomp is working - weight barely moved but my jeans fit differently around the quads and waist. Shoulders looking more defined in tank tops.

Biggest win: no injuries despite the fatigue. Foam rolling and mobility work on rest days saved me. Lower back tightness is manageable with proper warm-ups. 

Biggest struggle: SLEEP. I know I need 7+ hours but work and life keep interfering. This week I'm setting a hard 10:30pm bedtime alarm.

Body feels: 6.5/10. Functional and progressing but running on fumes. Need to prioritize recovery more or I'll burn out."
P04,2026-W02,20.6,19.42,49.2,1843,6.1,"Week 2 was a solid continuation with some real-world challenges that tested my adherence. I managed 4 out of 5 scheduled workouts, missing Friday's W15 Bulgarian split squats due to work running late and cumulative fatigue catching up with me. The sleep situation remains my biggest barrier - I averaged 6.1 hours this week, slightly worse than last week, and I definitely felt it in my recovery and energy levels.

Monday's W03 overhead press felt strong, hit all reps at 22.5kg and even contemplated adding weight for next cycle. Wednesday's W07 deadlifts were challenging - lower back still feels slightly fatigued from last week, so I maintained conservative loading and focused on form. The extended rest periods helped. Saturday's W11 back squats went well, felt more confident with depth and bracing. Sunday's W21 conditioning was tough - only managed 20 of 25 minutes before fatigue won out.

Diet adherence was around 78% this week. Had two slip-ups: Tuesday evening stress-snacking on dates and pistachios while dealing with a work deadline (+220 kcal over target), and Thursday grabbed a small kunafa slice at a family gathering (+180 kcal, couldn't refuse without being rude). Meal prep Sunday went well - made my chicken shawarma bowls again (they're becoming a staple), and Wednesday I prepped some kafta with vegetables. Budget came in at 38.7 SAR/day, comfortably under my 40 SAR limit.

Body composition changes are subtle but I'm noticing them: shoulders looking more defined, especially rear delts, and my jeans fit differently around the waist and thighs. Weight is essentially stable which is exactly what I want during recomp. The scale moved slightly down but within normal fluctuation range.

Lower back tightness persisted through mid-week, managed it with daily foam rolling (10 mins before bed) and longer warm-ups before lower body sessions. No sharp pain, just that deep fatigue feeling. I'm being cautious here - don't want to push into injury territory.

Menstrual cycle day 19 now - started noticing some early PMS symptoms Friday (mild bloating, slight energy dip) which probably contributed to missing that workout. I know from experience the next few days might be harder, so I'm planning to be flexible with intensity next week if needed.

Hydration stayed consistent at 2.5L daily. The weather's been mild so that helps. Took rest day walks on Tuesday and Thursday, about 25 minutes each, which felt good for active recovery without being taxing.

One positive note: I'm getting more efficient with meal prep and my cooking is improving. The kafta turned out really well this time - better spice balance than previous attempts. Intermediate cooking skills definitely paying off.

Overall, I'm pleased with the week despite the imperfections. The missed workout and diet slip-ups are disappointing but realistic given my schedule and sleep constraints. I'm learning to manage the fatigue better, though I really need to figure out how to get more sleep. That 6-hour average just isn't cutting it for optimal recovery, and I can feel it accumulating. Next week I'll try to get to bed 30 minutes earlier on at least 3 nights."
P04,2026-W03,20.5,19.48,49.6,1893,6,"Week 3 was challenging but overall productive. Started strong Monday and Tuesday with full adherence to both diet and training. Wednesday hit me hard - PMS symptoms intensified with bloating and fatigue, which made me skip the W11 workout and go over calories by about 300. I tried to compensate Thursday by being stricter with portions, completed W15 successfully despite feeling heavy. Friday was decent, stayed on track. Weekend was mixed - completed W21 Saturday morning which felt great for my mood, but Sunday I was exhausted from accumulated sleep debt and went over budget slightly buying a convenience meal when I didn't have energy to meal prep. 

Physically, I can see continued subtle changes in muscle definition, especially in my shoulders and quads. The scale is up slightly but I know it's water retention from PMS - my clothes fit the same or slightly better. Lower back felt good this week, the deload last week helped. However, the 6-hour sleep average is really catching up with me. I'm noticing slower recovery between sessions and more afternoon energy crashes. 

Budget-wise, I stayed within limits 5 out of 7 days. The two over-budget days were minor (Sunday's takeout was 52 SAR). Meal prep on Saturday helped set me up better. I'm learning that when PMS hits, I need to have more ready-to-eat protein options available because my motivation to cook drops significantly. 

Completed 4 out of 5 planned workouts again - same pattern as last week. The missed workout was Wednesday due to PMS symptoms. I'm recognizing this is likely to be a recurring pattern and might need to adjust my programming around my cycle. Overall adherence was around 75% this week, slightly down from last week due to the mid-week struggle."
P04,2026-W04,20.3,19.52,50.1,1798,6.1,"Week 4 was honestly a mixed bag. Started strong Monday and Tuesday, hitting all my targets and feeling good about the routine. Wednesday's W11 workout (the one I missed last week) went better this time - I pushed through even though my energy wasn't perfect. Thursday I had a rough night with only 5.2 hours of sleep and it showed in my W15 session - form suffered a bit on deadlifts so I dropped the weight 5kg to be safe. Friday's rest day was desperately needed.

The weekend was challenging. Saturday's W21 workout was solid, but I went out with friends Saturday night and ended up over my calorie target by about 380 kcal (shawarma wrap at 2am, not my finest moment but I was starving). Sunday I tried to compensate by being stricter but only hit about 1650 kcal. Overall adherence was around 78% for the week.

Sleep averaged 6.1 hours which is slightly better than last week but still not enough - I can feel the debt accumulating. My recovery between sessions isn't where it should be. The good news is I'm not in PMS phase this week so energy was more consistent, and my lower back continues to feel strong with no issues.

Visually I'm noticing more definition in my shoulders and upper back, which is motivating. The scale is up slightly but I think it's just normal fluctuation plus that Saturday night meal. My clothes fit the same or slightly better, so I'm not worried. Budget was fine - averaged 39.2 SAR/day, mostly meal prepped which saved money and kept me on track during the week."
P04,2026-W05,20.1,19.61,50,1755,6.3,"This week felt significantly better than previous weeks. My energy levels were more consistent throughout, probably because I'm in the follicular phase (days 15-21 of my cycle) which historically gives me better training sessions. I managed all 5 workouts this time, though W21 on Saturday was challenging due to a friend's birthday gathering earlier in the day.

The diet adherence was solid at around 82% for the week. I meal-prepped on Sunday which saved me both time and money - spent about 265 SAR for the week (37.9 SAR/day average), staying comfortably under my 40 SAR budget. Tuesday was my best day nutritionally, hitting macros almost perfectly. Thursday I went slightly over by about 220 kcal because of an unplanned shawarma dinner with colleagues, but I adjusted Friday to compensate.

Workouts felt strong, especially the upper body sessions (W03 and W15). I'm noticing better mind-muscle connection in my back exercises, and my pull-up negatives are getting smoother. W11 (leg day) was tough - still dealing with some DOMS from the previous week's deadlifts, but I pushed through with slightly reduced weight. Form remains my priority over load.

Sleep averaged 6.3 hours this week, which is a slight improvement. I've been trying to get to bed by 11 PM on workout nights, but Wednesday and Friday I stayed up past midnight catching up on a work project. I can definitely feel the difference in recovery when I get closer to 7 hours.

The Saturday workout (W21 - conditioning) was completed but at lower intensity than planned. I had eaten cake and some fried appetizers at the birthday party, felt a bit sluggish, and decided to do a modified version focusing on steady-state cardio rather than the planned HIIT intervals. Still counts as completion in my book since I showed up and moved for 40 minutes.

Visually, I'm seeing more definition in my shoulders and upper back. The scale hasn't moved much, which is expected for recomp, but my measurements are shifting slightly - waist down about 0.5cm, arms up about 0.3cm. These small wins keep me motivated.

One challenge this week: I'm starting to feel the mental fatigue of tracking everything so precisely. I'm considering a more intuitive approach for one meal per day while keeping the other meals structured. Will experiment with this next week.

Overall satisfaction: 8/10. Proud of my consistency and the fact that I'm learning to work with my body's natural rhythms rather than against them."
P04,2026-W06,20,19.68,50.4,1835,6.4,"Week 6 was a fascinating experiment in semi-intuitive eating while maintaining my recomp goals. I committed to letting one meal daily be more instinctive rather than strictly tracked, which felt liberating but also challenging given my 80% adherence propensity. 

Monday started strong with W03 workout - my energy was still riding the ovulation wave from last week, and I hit a new PR on my overhead press (32kg for 6 reps!). The intuitive lunch was a shawarma wrap that I estimated around 450 kcal, but honestly could've been 550. I compensated at dinner with a lighter protein-focused meal.

Tuesday's W07 session felt harder than expected. I'm now in my luteal phase (cycle day 22-23), and I could feel the shift. Energy dipped slightly, and I needed an extra rest between sets. Sleep was only 5.8 hours due to work stress, which didn't help. My intuitive meal was breakfast - I had labneh, zaatar, and olive oil with whole wheat bread, which felt nourishing but carb-heavy.

Wednesday was a rest day, and I used it to meal prep again. This has been my secret weapon for staying on budget (averaged 38.2 SAR/day this week). I batch-cooked chicken breast, roasted vegetables, and prepared overnight oats. The intuitive eating experiment meant I let myself have a small piece of kunafa my coworker brought in - about 150 kcal that I didn't stress over.

Thursday's W11 workout was solid but not spectacular. Luteal phase fatigue is real, and I'm learning to accept that not every session will feel powerful. I modified my intuitive meal to be dinner - grilled fish with tahini sauce and a generous salad. Felt satisfied without being stuffed.

Friday's W15 session was surprisingly good! I think the extra sleep Thursday night (7.1 hours) made a difference. My intuitive meal was a mid-afternoon snack when I felt genuinely hungry - dates, almonds, and Arabic coffee. Simple but hit the spot.

Saturday's W21 was modified again due to some PMS-related lower back sensitivity. I skipped deadlifts and did Romanian deadlifts with lighter weight instead, focusing on the stretch and contraction. My intuitive meal was lunch at a family gathering - I had kabsa with chicken and didn't track portions, just ate until satisfied. This was the biggest test of the week, and I think I did well listening to my body rather than my anxiety.

Sunday rest day I felt the week catching up with me. Weight is up slightly (water retention from luteal phase is expected), but I can see continued definition in my shoulders and upper back. The mirror shows more than the scale does.

Overall adherence was about 78% - slightly lower than my usual 82%, but that's because I intentionally gave myself permission to be less rigid. I went over target by about 150-200 kcal on Saturday, but under by similar amounts on Monday and Wednesday. Budget stayed solid. Sleep averaged 6.4 hours, which is actually an improvement.

The semi-intuitive eating experiment taught me that I can trust my hunger cues more than I thought, but I still benefit from structure for most meals. I'm thinking of continuing this approach - track breakfast and dinner tightly, let lunch be more flexible. It reduces decision fatigue and lets me be more social.

Body composition feels like it's still trending positively despite the scale uptick. My jeans fit better in the waist, and my t-shirts are tighter in the shoulders. That's the recomp magic. Next week I'll be in full luteal phase, so I'm planning to be gentler with myself, maybe add an extra rest day if needed, and focus on maintenance rather than pushing PRs."
P04,2026-W07,19.7,19.75,49.8,1798,6.6,"Week 7 of 2026 was a solid training block despite some luteal phase challenges carrying over from last week. Started the week feeling heavier from water retention but energy improved mid-week as I transitioned into my follicular phase (period started Wednesday). Managed all 5 workouts with good intensity - W03 Monday felt tough initially but hit a nice groove, W07 Wednesday was surprisingly strong post-period start, W11 Friday was excellent with increased energy, W15 Saturday maintained momentum, and W21 Sunday required slight modification again (substituted Bulgarian split squats for back squats due to residual lower back tightness). 

Diet adherence hovered around 82% this week - continued the semi-intuitive approach with one untracked meal daily, which is working well psychologically. Monday and Tuesday were slightly over target (+150 kcal and +100 kcal estimated) as I navigated end-of-luteal-phase cravings, but Wednesday through Sunday tightened up nicely. Thursday I was actually under by about 120 kcal due to reduced appetite post-period. Budget compliance was excellent at 37.8 SAR/day average - Sunday meal prep with chicken thighs, rice, and frozen vegetables continues to be cost-effective.

Sleep improved to 6.6 hours average (range 6.0-7.3hr) - made a conscious effort to get to bed earlier Wednesday through Friday, which paid dividends in recovery and workout quality. Still not ideal, but better than last week's 6.4hr average. The extra sleep definitely helped with the follicular phase energy boost.

Recovery was good overall. Used foam rolling and light stretching on rest days (Tuesday, Thursday). No injuries or significant soreness beyond normal DOMS. The lower back sensitivity from last week resolved by Thursday. PMS symptoms (bloating, increased hunger, mild cramping) subsided by Thursday as expected.

Body composition continues trending positively - weight dropped as water retention cleared (expected pattern), and visual changes are encouraging. Waist looks leaner, shoulder and arm definition improving. Overhead press strength holding at 32kg x6, and I'm feeling confident about pushing for 33kg next week. Hip thrusts on W21 felt strong at 80kg x10.

The semi-intuitive eating approach is proving sustainable - it removes some of the mental burden of tracking every bite while keeping me generally on target. I'm learning to trust my hunger cues better, especially now that I'm tracking my cycle more carefully. Planning to continue this approach but may tighten tracking during the next luteal phase if I notice adherence slipping.

Overall: strong week with good momentum heading into follicular phase. Excited to leverage increased energy over the next 10-14 days for potential PRs and tighter diet adherence."
P04,2026-W08,19.4,19.85,49.6,1742,7.1,"Week 8 was solid overall. I came into this week feeling pretty good from last week's progress, and I wanted to capitalize on that follicular phase energy I know is coming. Started the week still dealing with tail-end period symptoms Monday/Tuesday, but energy picked up significantly by Wednesday as expected.

Workouts were strong across the board. Hit all 5 sessions (W03, W07, W11, W15, W21) without missing any, though I did have to modify one exercise on Sunday - swapped back squats for Bulgarian split squats again because the rack was occupied and I didn't want to wait 20 minutes. The overhead press is still holding steady at 32kg x6, which feels like a plateau I need to strategically break through. I'm thinking of incorporating some accessory work or changing the rep scheme next week.

Diet adherence was around 78-80% this week, slightly down from last week's 82%, but still in my typical range. I tracked most meals but had two instances where I eyeballed portions at a work lunch and a family dinner. Budget came in at 38.2 SAR/day, so just slightly over my 40 SAR target but well within acceptable range. The protein target of 110g was hit on 5 out of 7 days - the two social eating situations made it harder to hit macros precisely.

Sleep was the real win this week. I maintained my conscious effort to prioritize rest and averaged 7.1 hours, which is a significant improvement from my baseline 6.6. I can definitely feel the difference in recovery and workout performance. I've been setting a firm 'wind-down' alarm at 22:00 and it's helping.

Body composition feels like it's continuing to trend positively. Water retention was minimal this week, and I'm noticing more definition in my shoulders and upper back. The scale moved down slightly but I'm not concerned - visual progress and performance metrics matter more to me than the number. I can see more muscle separation and my clothes fit differently.

Recovery protocols stayed consistent: foam rolling on rest days, 10-15 minutes of stretching, and I added some light walking on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. No injuries, no unusual soreness beyond normal DOMS.

Looking ahead, I'm in prime position to push intensity next week. Hormonal window is optimal, sleep is improved, and I'm feeling strong. Planning to add an extra set to compound movements and possibly increase weight on a few lifts. The recomp is working - slow and steady wins this race."
P04,2026-W09,19.1,20,49.7,1756,7.2,"Week 9 complete and honestly feeling really strong! Started Monday with W03 (upper power) and the push press felt amazing - hit all my sets with better form than last cycle. Tuesday's W07 lower hypertrophy was tough but manageable, though my quads were screaming by the end of those tempo squats. 

Diet adherence was solid at around 82% this week - I managed to stay within my 40 SAR/day budget by meal prepping Sunday evening (chicken, rice, and roasted vegetables in bulk). Had one unplanned meal out on Thursday with friends where I went maybe 200-300 kcal over target, but I adjusted Friday's portions to compensate. The protein target of 110g was easier to hit this week since I found a good deal on eggs and Greek yogurt at the local market.

Wednesday's W11 (upper hypertrophy) had me doing a ton of volume on accessories - my shoulders were pumped but I had to really focus on not rushing through the sets. Thursday was W15 (lower power) and I love how explosive I'm feeling on box jumps and trap bar deadlifts. The DOMS from that session carried into Friday but didn't stop me from crushing W21. Actually had to substitute Bulgarian split squats for back squats again due to the rack being occupied during peak hours at the gym, but honestly my glutes and quads got just as much work.

Sleep averaged 7.2 hours this week which is slightly above my recent average - I've been more disciplined about putting my phone away by 10 PM and that's helping. Energy levels were consistently high, especially mid-week onward. No period issues this week which definitely contributed to better training quality.

Recovery protocols on point: foam rolling after every session, 10 minutes of stretching before bed most nights, and I've been drinking way more water (around 2.5L daily). Visually I'm noticing more definition in my shoulders and upper back, and my jeans fit differently around the glutes and quads - definitely seeing the recomp progress continue.

No injuries or concerning aches. Right knee felt a tiny bit cranky on Thursday during warm-up but loosened up completely after some dynamic stretches. Planning to increase intensity next week as noted - might add 2.5kg to some of my main lifts and reduce rest periods slightly on hypertrophy days. Feeling confident and motivated!"
P04,2026-W10,18.8,20.2,49.9,1790,7.1,"This week went pretty well overall! I managed to stick to the meal plan about 80% of the time. The Ful Medames breakfast was filling and kept me energized through my morning workouts. I really enjoyed the grilled chicken with Mujadara - it became my favorite meal. The sambousek was delicious but I found myself wanting a bit more protein in that meal. I hit all 5 gym sessions as planned, and the advanced workouts were challenging but manageable at my intermediate level. I felt strong during back and leg days especially. My energy levels were consistent throughout the week, and I noticed I felt less bloated than usual. The Arabic coffee with Maamoul was a nice treat that kept me satisfied. I did have one day where I went slightly over calories at a family gathering, but I compensated the next day. Sleep was good, averaging around my usual 7 hours. I can feel my muscles responding well to the training, especially in my shoulders and arms. Looking forward to continuing this plan!"
P04,2026-W11,18.3,20.4,49.7,1698,7,"This first week went pretty well overall! I managed to stick to the meal plan about 80% of the time. The hummus and pita breakfast was filling and easy to prep. I really enjoyed the grilled fish meals - they were satisfying and I felt energized after. The labneh snack was perfect between meals. I did skip the stuffed peppers twice because I ran out of time to cook them, so I had grilled chicken with rice instead. The workouts were challenging but doable - the advanced routines really pushed me, especially legs day. I felt sore after each session but in a good way. My energy levels were solid throughout the week, and I didn't experience any major hunger or cravings. Sleep stayed consistent around 7 hours. I'm noticing my clothes fitting slightly better already, and I feel a bit tighter in my arms and shoulders. Looking forward to continuing!"
P04,2026-W12,17.8,20.6,49.5,1745,6.9,"This week went pretty well overall! I managed to stick to the meal plan about 80% of the time. The shakshuka became my favorite breakfast - so flavorful and filling. I did swap the energy balls for a protein shake twice when I was rushing between classes. The chicken kabsa was delicious but took longer to prep than expected, so I meal-prepped it for 3 days mid-week which helped a lot. Training sessions were intense - the advanced workouts really pushed me, especially legs day. I felt stronger by the end of the week and noticed better muscle definition in my arms and shoulders. My energy levels were consistently high, and I didn't experience any major hunger or cravings. Sleep was solid at 7 hours most nights, though I stayed up late studying one night and only got 6 hours.

P04,2026-W47,4.2,27.2,50.8,1820,7.4,"This first week was challenging but rewarding! I managed to stick to the meal plan about 80% of the time - the hummus breakfast became my favorite, and I loved the variety of Middle Eastern flavors. I did swap out a couple of meals when I was too tired to prep after workouts. The advanced gym workouts were intense - my shoulders and legs are still feeling it! I hit all 5 workout days as planned. Energy levels were good throughout the week, though I felt pretty sore after the leg day. The 1780 kcal target felt appropriate - I wasn't starving but also wasn't overly full. I did have one cheat meal on Friday night with friends. Overall, I'm pleased with my adherence and excited to see some early changes in muscle definition, especially in my arms and shoulders."
P04,2026-W48,4,27.4,51,1795,7.4,"This week went pretty well overall! I managed to stick to the meal plan about 80% of the time. The Ful Medames breakfast was filling and easy to prep, which helped me stay consistent in the mornings. I really enjoyed the grilled chicken kebabs and Mujadara combo - it became my favorite meal. The shrimp Kabsa was delicious but took a bit longer to prepare on busy days, so I had to substitute with simpler options twice. The gym workouts were challenging but manageable at my intermediate level, though the advanced programming pushed me hard. I completed all 5 workout days as planned. My energy levels were good throughout the week, and I felt stronger during the back and leg sessions by the end of the week. I did have one day where I went slightly over my calorie target due to a family gathering, but I compensated the next day. Sleep was consistent around my usual 7.4 hours. I'm noticing slight improvements in muscle definition, especially in my shoulders and arms. The 40 SAR daily budget worked well for getting quality ingredients from local markets."
P05,2025-W46,31.4,34.6,95.5,1950,6,"This week was honestly a mixed bag for me. The diet plan itself wasn't too bad - I actually liked the ful medames breakfast and the kabsa was pretty solid. But I'm not gonna lie, sticking to it every single day got repetitive by day 4. I ended up grabbing shawarma with friends on Thursday night and had some extra snacks a couple times when I was studying late. The workouts were BRUTAL though. Those advanced programs are no joke for someone at my level - my legs were absolutely destroyed after the first leg day and I could barely walk for two days. I had to skip some exercises and use lighter weights than programmed. Sleep was rough too, averaging around 6 hours because of university assignments and just scrolling on my phone before bed. I can feel some changes in my energy levels and my clothes fit slightly better, but it's hard to stay motivated when the workouts feel way too intense and I'm constantly tired. Need to figure out how to be more consistent with the meal plan without feeling like I'm eating the exact same thing every day."
P05,2025-W47,31,34.5,94.8,1720,6,"This week was tough, not gonna lie. Started with good intentions on Monday but the workouts (W25 and W21) were way more intense than what I'm used to as a beginner. I pushed through the first session but had to skip some exercises because my form was breaking down and I didn't want to get injured. The diet plan was decent - hit around 1600-1800 calories most days instead of the full 2880 because honestly that felt like too much food and I'm trying to lose fat anyway. My cooking skills are pretty basic so I stuck to simple stuff like grilled chicken, rice, and frozen veggies. Grabbed fast food twice this week when I was too tired to cook after work. Sleep stayed at my usual 6 hours - tried to get more but just couldn't fall asleep earlier. By Wednesday my legs were absolutely destroyed from the DOMS, could barely walk down stairs. Skipped Thursday's workout completely because of it. Got back to it Saturday but did a lighter version. The budget of 30 SAR per day was tight but manageable when I cooked at home, though those two takeout meals pushed me over. Feeling discouraged about the workout difficulty but I know I need to stick with it. Scale showed a small drop which is motivating. Need to find a way to modify these workouts to match my actual fitness level better."
P05,2025-W48,30.6,34.3,93.4,1620,6,"Week 48 simulation complete. Started ambitious with 2861 kcal target and 4 workouts, but reality hit hard. My beginner status and 6-hour sleep made this tough. Day 1 workout (W25) was brutal - couldn't complete half the exercises with proper form. Switched to lighter variations mid-session. DOMS kicked in Day 2-3, making even walking painful. Skipped Day 3 workout entirely because my legs were screaming. Diet was all over the place - some days I hit 1700 kcal, others barely 1400 because I wasn't hungry and didn't want to force feed. Had Shawarma twice when meal prep failed (cooking skill issues). Day 5 modified W21 to basically bodyweight exercises. Budget blew out because I bought pre-made meals when too sore/tired to cook. The 55% adherence feels accurate - I tried, but between poor sleep, beginner limitations, and recovery issues, I couldn't maintain the plan. Lost some weight (probably water and glycogen) but definitely not sustainable at this intensity."
P05,2025-W49,30.4,34.1,92.8,1850,5.9,"Week 2 (W49) was significantly harder than I expected. Coming off last week's brutal DOMS experience, I started this week already feeling defeated and sore. My adherence dropped even further - I only managed 1.5 workouts out of the planned 4, and my diet compliance was around 48%. 

Day 1 (Monday): Attempted W25 workout but my legs were still recovering from previous week. Completed warm-up and first two exercises with poor form before stopping. Ate reasonably well - around 2100 kcal, mostly because I meal-prepped some chicken and rice on Sunday night.

Day 2 (Tuesday): Rest day. Woke up with residual soreness. Stuck to budget meals (eggs, bread, chicken) but portion sizes were off. Around 1800 kcal. Sleep was rough - only got 5.5 hours due to work stress.

Day 3 (Wednesday): Planned W21 workout but completely skipped it. I got home late from work (around 8 PM), exhausted, and just couldn't motivate myself. Ordered shawarma (off-plan meal #1) - probably 1200 kcal in that meal alone. Total for day: ~1950 kcal.

Day 4 (Thursday): Another rest day, but felt guilty about skipping Wednesday. Tried to eat cleaner - oatmeal, canned tuna, vegetables. Got about 1650 kcal. Sleep improved to 6.5 hours.

Day 5 (Friday): Attempted W25 again. This time I modified heavily - did bodyweight squats instead of barbell, skipped deadlifts entirely, did some push-ups and planks. Maybe 30 minutes total, very light intensity. Felt better mentally for doing SOMETHING. Food was decent: 2000 kcal, mostly whole foods.

Day 6 (Saturday): Should have done W21 but went out with friends instead. Ended up at a fast-food place (off-plan meal #2) - burger and fries. Probably consumed 2400 kcal for the day. Only got 5 hours of sleep due to staying out late.

Day 7 (Sunday): Completely skipped planned workout. Felt bloated and tired from Saturday. Did some meal prep for next week but energy was low. Ate around 1700 kcal - chicken, rice, some vegetables.

The W25/W21 programming continues to be too advanced for my current fitness level. I can't complete the prescribed sets and reps, and the complexity of the movements (especially with barbell work) is intimidating when I'm alone at home with no spotter or proper form check. The 2730 kcal target also feels impossible to hit consistently on my 30 SAR/day budget while eating clean - I'm constantly choosing between hitting calories or hitting protein, and usually falling short on both.

My motivation is at an all-time low. I spent about 245 SAR this week (15 SAR over budget) due to the two off-plan meals and some extra protein sources I tried to buy. The scale barely moved, and I don't see any visible changes. I'm starting to wonder if this approach is right for me, or if I need something more sustainable and beginner-appropriate.

Physically, I'm less sore than last week, but that's mainly because I barely worked out. My energy levels are poor - the 6 hours of sleep isn't cutting it, especially with work demands. I feel like I'm in a cycle of planning to work out, failing to execute, feeling guilty, eating poorly to cope, then repeating.

Positives: I did manage 1.5 workouts (better than 0), and I'm learning what doesn't work for me. I also realize I need to either find a simpler program or get some in-person coaching to learn proper form."
P05,2025-W50,30.3,33.7,91.6,1720,5.8,"Week 3 has been the hardest yet. I started Monday with some hope after the weekend, but reality hit fast. The 2806 kcal target feels impossible when I'm this exhausted and my budget is already stretched. I managed to hit the gym twice this week, but both sessions were heavily modified versions of W25 - I just can't do the barbell work safely when I'm running on 5-6 hours of sleep and minimal food. 

The diet adherence crashed to around 40% this week. I averaged maybe 1720 kcal per day, which is over 1000 kcal below target. I had three off-plan meals (Tuesday night I grabbed a cheap burger because I was too tired to cook, Thursday was shawarma again, and Sunday I just ate whatever was easy). My protein is probably around 85g daily - I know it should be 210g but chicken breast and eggs add up fast on 30 SAR/day, especially when I need to buy other food too.

Workouts were 1.5 out of 4 completed. Monday I did about 60% of W25 Day 1 - some dumbbell work and bodyweight stuff, skipped the barbell movements entirely. Wednesday I was supposed to do W21 but I was so drained I just walked on the treadmill for 20 minutes. Friday I attempted W25 Day 3 and got through maybe half before my energy completely tanked. Sunday's W21 session didn't happen - I slept through my alarm.

Sleep averaged 5.8 hours this week (range: 5-6.5 hours). I'm in a vicious cycle: can't sleep well because I'm stressed about not hitting targets, then can't hit targets because I'm exhausted. The guilt is eating me alive. I spent about 248 SAR this week, which is 38 SAR over budget for the week. I had to buy some basics mid-week and prices are just higher than I budgeted for.

The psychological weight is the worst part. Every skipped workout, every meal that doesn't hit macros, every night of bad sleep - it all piles up. I feel like I'm failing at something that should be straightforward. The W25/W21 programming still feels completely wrong for where I'm at. I need something I can actually complete, not something that makes me feel inadequate every single session.

I'm starting to think I need to either find a way to get professional help (trainer, nutritionist, something) or completely redesign this myself with much lower targets. The current approach isn't sustainable and I can feel myself spiraling."
P05,2025-W51,29.8,33,90.3,1800,6,"Week 4 (2025-W51) was the breaking point I desperately needed, though not in the way I'd hoped. Coming off three weeks of spiraling failure, I knew something had to change. The pattern was clear: 5.8 hours of sleep, chronic stress, impossible workouts (W25/W21), and a massive caloric deficit leaving me exhausted and guilty.

Monday started with good intentions. I woke up at 6:15am after only 5.5 hours of sleep, groggy and unmotivated. I attempted W25 Day 1 but my body just... gave up. I completed maybe 35% - some warm-up movements, two sets of the first exercise, then I sat on the bench staring at my phone for 10 minutes before leaving. The defeat was crushing. Diet-wise, I managed breakfast (eggs, toast) and a protein shake, but lunch was a cheap shawarma again (95 SAR overspent already in my head from last week). Dinner was skipped. Total: ~1450 kcal, maybe 70g protein.

Tuesday I didn't even attempt the gym. Work stress hit hard, and I slept terribly (5 hours). I grabbed convenience foods: packaged sandwiches, chips, an energy drink to stay awake. Around 1600 kcal, mostly carbs and fat. I felt like a failure but was too exhausted to care.

Wednesday was supposed to be W25 Day 2. I went to the gym at 7pm, changed into my workout clothes, and just... walked on the treadmill for 25 minutes at a slow pace while watching YouTube. It was all I could manage. I told myself 'something is better than nothing' but felt pathetic. Diet was slightly better: chicken and rice from a budget place (55 SAR), protein shake, some fruit. Maybe 1850 kcal, 95g protein.

Thursday was my turning point, but not a good one. I woke up after 6.5 hours of sleep (best of the week) and realized I was dizzy when standing. I've been under-eating for weeks, barely sleeping, and pushing a body that's screaming for rest. I made a decision: I'm not going to the gym today, and I'm going to actually eat. I had a proper breakfast, a full lunch with colleagues (which broke my budget further - 45 SAR), and a decent dinner. Total: ~2200 kcal. No workout. I felt guilty but also... relieved?

Friday I attempted W25 Day 3, managing about 45% completion. My strength felt slightly better after actually eating Thursday, but the programming is still far beyond my current capacity. The workout calls for complex movements and rep schemes I can't execute with proper form. I'm not recovering between sessions, and my sleep debt is astronomical. Diet: 1750 kcal, 80g protein. Budget meal prep is falling apart.

Saturday (W21 scheduled) I completely skipped. I slept until 10am (7 hours! - my body finally crashed), and spent the day doing laundry, meal prep attempts, and just... existing. I made simple chicken, rice, and vegetables for the next few days. Ate about 1900 kcal. No guilt today, just acceptance that I can't continue like this.

Sunday I did a modified workout - completely ignored the W21 programming and just did basic movements I actually know: bodyweight squats, push-ups (on knees), dumbbell rows, and 20 minutes of walking. It felt... good? Like I was actually exercising instead of failing at exercise. Total time: 40 minutes. Diet: 1850 kcal from my meal prep.

Week totals: 1.75/4 workouts completed (being generous with my definitions), average 1800 kcal/day (1035 kcal deficit from target), estimated 82g protein/day (129g short), 6.0 hours sleep average (up from 5.8 - small win), and budget disaster: ~285 SAR spent vs 210 SAR target (75 SAR overage).

Physically, I'm lighter but I look worse. My face is gaunt, my lifts have stalled or regressed, and I'm constantly cold. The scale dropped but I'm losing muscle along with fat. My clothes fit looser but I don't look 'fit' - I look depleted. Energy levels are rock bottom except for Thursday when I actually ate properly.

Mentally, I'm in crisis. The guilt-stress-insomnia cycle is real and vicious. Every missed workout adds to my anxiety, which ruins my sleep, which tanks my energy, which causes me to miss more workouts. I'm stuck in a pattern I can't break alone. The W25/W21 programming is demoralizing - it's designed for someone with a training base, proper recovery, and adequate nutrition. I have none of these.

The brutal truth: I need help. I need a program designed for actual beginners with recovery constraints. I need to eat at a smaller deficit (maybe 500 kcal, not 1000+). I need to prioritize sleep over early morning workouts. I need to accept that 4 days/week might be too much right now. And I need to stop the shame spiral that's making everything worse.

I'm not quitting, but I can't continue this path. Week 4 was a 40% adherence week overall, same as Week 3, but it felt different - less like failure, more like a wake-up call. Something has to change, and it has to start with realistic expectations and self-compassion I haven't shown myself."
P05,2025-W52,30.5,31.8,88.1,1775,5.9,"Week 5 became a turning point, but not in the way I hoped. After last week's crisis, I tried telling myself Monday would be different - I'd follow the plan, hit my calories, get proper sleep. Reality hit hard.

Monday started with good intentions. Woke up exhausted after 5.5 hours sleep, dragged myself to W25 Day 1. Got through the warm-up and first exercise, then just... stopped. Standing there in the gym, I felt this wave of complete emptiness. Not even guilt anymore, just hollow. Completed maybe 30% before walking out. Grabbed a shawarma on the way home (190 SAR left for the week already). Ate 1650 kcal total - my stomach's shrunk so much that normal portions feel huge.

Tuesday I made a decision: I'm taking a real break. Not 'skipping' - actively choosing rest. Slept 7 hours for the first time in weeks. Didn't track food, just ate when hungry. Maybe 1900 kcal? Felt guilty but also... relieved? My body needed this.

Wednesday, tried W21. The 'easier' program felt impossible. My strength is just gone. Exercises I could do a month ago - can't hit the reps. Had to modify everything, use lighter weights, rest longer. Finished about 50% of prescribed work. The guy next to me was warming up with my working weight. That stung. Budget crisis deepened - bought pre-made protein box (expensive but I couldn't face cooking). Down to 95 SAR with 4 days left.

Thursday and Friday blurred together. Skipped both workouts. Thursday I slept 6.5 hours, Friday only 5. The guilt-insomnia cycle is back but different - now it's mixed with this resignation. I know I'm failing but I'm too tired to care properly. Ate around 1750-1800 kcal both days, mostly cheap carbs and whatever protein I could afford. Bought bulk eggs and rice. Budget completely blown - had to dip into next week's money.

Saturday I looked in the mirror and barely recognized myself. I'm gaunt. My face is hollow, collarbones jutting out, but I still have this belly fat that won't budge. The worst kind of skinny-fat. I'm cold constantly - wearing two layers indoors. Did a 30-minute walk just to move, but it felt like I was dragging dead weight.

Sunday, rock bottom. Slept 5 hours, woke up with a pounding headache. Skipped the workout entirely. Sat down and actually calculated: I've been in a 1000+ calorie deficit for a month while trying to do intermediate programming on beginner recovery capacity with chronic sleep deprivation. No wonder I'm falling apart.

The scale shows 88.1 kg - I've lost 2.2 kg this week alone. But my clothes fit weird - loose in the arms and chest, tight around the middle. I'm losing muscle faster than fat. My lifts have regressed to below where I started. I'm weaker, more tired, and honestly scared about what I'm doing to myself.

I completed 1.5 out of 4 planned workouts (38% adherence). Diet averaged maybe 1775 kcal vs 2738 target - a 963 kcal daily deficit that's clearly unsustainable. Sleep averaged 5.9 hours. Budget disaster: spent approximately 340 SAR on 210 SAR budget (130 SAR overage, had to borrow from next week).

The notes say 'urgent intervention needed' and they're right. I can't keep doing this. I need to either get actual help - a real coach, a nutritionist, maybe even therapy for the stress-guilt cycle - or I need to completely redesign this myself. Smaller deficit, way easier workouts, sleep as priority #1. Maybe even take a full week off to recover.

I'm at a crossroads. Part of me wants to quit entirely. Another part knows I'll hate myself if I do. But continuing like this isn't working either - it's just slow-motion self-destruction. I've lost weight but I look and feel worse than when I started. That's not progress, that's just... damage.

Next week, something has to fundamentally change. I can't willpower my way through this anymore."
P05,2026-W01,30.8,30.9,86.2,1650,5.7,"Week 6 was supposed to be different. I told myself after last week's collapse that I'd get it together, but honestly? It was more of the same downward slide, just with slightly different flavors of failure.

Monday started with W25 Day 1 again - my third attempt at this workout in two weeks. I managed about 45% of it this time, which felt like a victory compared to last week's 30% emotional shutdown, but it's still pathetic. My arms were shaking during the warm-up push-ups. The barbell squats that used to feel manageable at 40kg? I'm down to 30kg and even that feels heavy. I can see it in the mirror at the gym - my shoulders look narrower, my chest is flat, but I've still got this soft layer around my midsection that won't budge. I'm literally getting smaller and fatter at the same time.

Tuesday I actually showed up for W21, which surprised me. Got through maybe 55% before my lower back started screaming during deadlifts. I had to drop the weight twice mid-set. The guy next to me was warming up with what I was struggling to lift. That comparison trap is poisonous, I know, but it's hard not to notice.

Wednesday was supposed to be W25 Day 3, but I woke up so exhausted I couldn't even think about it. Skipped. Thursday I dragged myself in for W21 again and managed about 40%. My form is falling apart - I can feel it. Everything feels loose and uncoordinated. I'm pretty sure I'm going to hurt myself if I keep pushing like this.

Friday through Sunday: nothing. Complete shutdown. I didn't even do a walk. Just stayed in my room mostly, scrolling through my phone, feeling the hours drain away.

The diet situation is beyond crisis now - it's just reality. I'm eating whatever I can afford, which means a lot of white rice, cheap bread, and the occasional egg or chicken when I can stretch the budget. I estimated maybe 1,650 calories per day this week, and protein was probably around 70g on good days. I'm hungry all the time, but I'm also too tired to care about eating properly. The budget is completely blown - I'm at about 380 SAR spent over the past two weeks when I should be at 420 SAR total. I've been borrowing from my rent money. That's a new low.

Sleep is still terrible. 5.7 hours average this week. I lie awake thinking about how badly I'm failing, then I'm too tired to function the next day, then I feel guilty about wasting the day, then I can't sleep again. Perfect cycle.

I weighed myself today and I'm down another 1.9kg. That's 4.1kg in two weeks. I know that's not healthy. I can see it - my face looks gaunt, my collarbones are prominent, but my stomach still pouches out when I sit down. I'm cold constantly. My hands shake sometimes. This morning I felt dizzy standing up from bed.

The scary part? I'm starting to feel numb about it. Last week I was panicking. This week I'm just... resigned? Like I'm watching myself fail from outside my body. I know I need help. I know this is unsustainable. I know I'm probably doing long-term damage. But the gap between knowing and doing feels impossibly wide right now.

I did have one moment of clarity on Saturday night. I was lying in bed, too wired to sleep despite being exhausted, and I realized: I'm not on a fitness journey anymore. I'm just in a slow-motion health crisis. The program isn't the problem - I am. Or rather, the way I'm trying to do this is fundamentally broken.

I need to eat more. I need to sleep more. I need to do less. Those three things are obvious. But actually implementing them feels like trying to turn around an aircraft carrier with a paddle. Everything is connected - the budget affects the food, the food affects the energy, the energy affects the sleep, the sleep affects the workouts, the failed workouts affect my mental state, and around and around.

I think I'm scared to actually change because changing means admitting I've been doing this wrong for six weeks. It means letting go of the aggressive deficit, the ambitious workout schedule, the idea that I can willpower my way through this. It means accepting that I'm more broken down than I thought.

But here's the thing: I'm still writing this entry. I'm still tracking. Some tiny part of me hasn't given up completely. I just don't know if that's resilience or stubbornness at this point."
P05,2026-W02,30.5,30.4,85.1,1850,6.1,"Week 7 complete. I need to be honest - this was supposed to be a recovery week where I stopped training and ate more, but I couldn't fully commit to either. The dissociation I mentioned last week got worse. I'd stare at my meal prep notes for 20 minutes without moving, or stand in front of the gym deciding whether to go in. I managed 2 workouts instead of the prescribed 4, both at maybe 50% effort. The tremors in my hands are constant now - I noticed while trying to load plates that my grip feels weak and shaky. Diet improved slightly because I forced myself to buy rotisserie chicken twice (60 SAR total, way over budget but I was desperate for easy protein). Still only hitting maybe 1,850 kcal/day instead of the 2,626 target. Sleep got marginally better at 6.1 hours because I was too exhausted to stay awake with guilt. The scary part: I've stopped feeling hungry. My body just... gave up asking. I lost another 1.1kg this week, and I can see my shoulder bones clearly now. A coworker asked if I was sick. I lied and said I had the flu. The numbness is almost comfortable compared to the panic from weeks ago, which I know is a bad sign. I keep thinking I should ask for help but then I don't know what I'd even say. 'I'm slowly destroying myself following a fitness plan?' It sounds ridiculous. But I also know this can't continue. Maybe next week."
P05,2026-W03,29.8,28.9,83.1,1485,6.4,"Week 8 became the breaking point I'd been circling for months. Monday started with me staring at the meal plan - 2,539 kcal, 190g protein - numbers that felt like they belonged to someone else's life. The tremors in my hands made it hard to hold my phone steady while logging. I knew I was in trouble, but the 'comfortable numbness' had become a prison.

The first two days, I barely ate. Maybe 1,200 kcal each day. Rotisserie chicken again because I couldn't think of anything else, but even that tasted like cardboard. My body had stopped sending hunger signals entirely. I'd sit with food in front of me and just... stare. The dissociation was complete - like watching someone else fail from behind glass.

Wednesday morning I couldn't get out of bed for the workout. Not 'didn't want to' - physically couldn't. My legs wouldn't respond properly. I called in sick to work for the first time, told them it was a stomach bug. Spent the day sleeping in 90-minute chunks, waking up disoriented each time. The cold sensitivity was so bad I wore two hoodies indoors with the heat on.

Thursday something shifted. Maybe it was seeing 82.3kg on the scale (I'd lost another 2.8kg in 4 days), or the way my coworker asked if I was okay with genuine concern in his eyes, or just animal survival instinct kicking in. I used my lunch break to search 'signs of starvation' and the list read like my diary: rapid weight loss, muscle wasting, tremors, cold intolerance, fatigue, loss of appetite, difficulty concentrating. The phrase 'refeeding syndrome' scared me enough to finally text my older brother.

He video-called immediately. Seeing his face - the shock in his expression when he saw me - broke through the fog. He made me promise to see a doctor and sent me 500 SAR 'no arguments, not a loan.' That money felt like a lifeline and a failure simultaneously.

Friday I managed a doctor's appointment (280 SAR, covered by brother's money). The physician was direct: 'You're in acute malnutrition. BMI approaching underweight, showing signs of muscle catabolism, possible electrolyte imbalances. We need bloodwork immediately.' He ordered comprehensive labs (another 350 SAR) and gave me strict instructions: minimum 2,000 kcal daily, focus on easily digestible foods, stop all exercise for one week, follow-up in 5 days.

The weekend was about tiny steps. I bought easy foods with the remaining money: yogurt, bananas, peanut butter, white rice, eggs. Nothing that required 'cooking' because I had no energy for that. Saturday and Sunday I hit about 1,600-1,700 kcal each day - still under target but double my recent intake. No workouts per doctor's orders. Sleep improved slightly (6.5hr average) probably because my body was desperate to heal.

The tremors are still there but slightly less constant. The scale showed 83.1kg by Sunday - I'd regained 0.8kg, probably water and glycogen as my body started getting fuel again. I'm terrified of gaining fat, but I'm more terrified of what the doctor said about 'cardiac complications from prolonged malnutrition.'

Workout adherence: 0/4 sessions (0%). Doctor-mandated rest, but honestly I couldn't have done them anyway. Diet adherence: maybe 60% of target calories, 40% of protein target. Still failing, but failing upward for the first time in two months.

I've agreed to weekly check-ins with my brother and the follow-up appointment Friday. The crisis isn't over - I'm still severely compromised - but I finally accepted I can't do this alone. The 'comfortable numbness' is fading, replaced by fear and something that might be hope. I don't know if I've caused permanent damage. The doctor mentioned possible long-term metabolic effects, bone density concerns, and the need for mental health support.

This week taught me that rock bottom has a basement. But also that asking for help isn't weakness - it's the only thing that saved me from hospitalization."
P05,2026-W04,28.9,29.2,85.1,2300,6.8,"Week 9 Report - Medical Recovery Phase:

This week was completely different from the nightmare of Week 8. Having my brother's support and the doctor's strict orders gave me structure when I couldn't create it myself. The fear of permanent damage is real now - not abstract anymore.

Monday-Tuesday: Still felt weak but the tremors were less intense. Following the refeeding protocol was hard because my appetite is still suppressed, but I forced myself to eat every 3 hours like the doctor ordered. The 2,000 kcal minimum felt impossible at first. I managed about 1,850 kcal Monday, then pushed to 2,100 Tuesday. No workouts - doctor's orders, and honestly I couldn't have done them anyway.

Wednesday-Thursday: Energy started returning in small waves. I could walk to the corner store without feeling dizzy. Hit 2,200 kcal Wednesday, and Thursday I actually felt hungry for the first time in weeks - managed 2,400 kcal. The meal plan helped because it's structured, though I simplified some recipes due to my beginner cooking skills. Protein shakes became my friend for hitting protein targets without feeling overly full.

Friday: Follow-up appointment. Blood work came back - doctor said I was 'lucky' because electrolytes were low-normal but not critical, liver enzymes slightly elevated but recovering, testosterone low (expected with malnutrition). He was pleased with the 2kg weight gain but warned most is water and glycogen restoration. Cleared me for light walking only, no resistance training yet. Need another week of recovery minimum. This news was both relieving and frustrating.

Weekend: Pushed calories to 2,500-2,600 to accelerate recovery. Sleep improved to almost 7 hours - probably because my body isn't in crisis mode anymore. Took short 15-minute walks both days. My brother checked in Saturday and we talked about what happened. First time I've really opened up about the mental spiral. He's helping me set up the mental health referral appointment.

Physically: Weight climbed to 85.1kg by Sunday. I know it's mostly water, glycogen, and digestive content, but seeing the scale go up doesn't trigger panic like I thought it would - I'm just relieved to not be dying. Muscle mass probably gained minimally (maybe 0.3kg actual tissue), but the rehydration makes measurements unreliable. Still look gaunt but less skeletal. Grip strength slightly better.

Mentally: The fog is lifting. I can focus on tasks for more than 10 minutes now. The dissociation is less constant. But I'm also confronting what I did to myself, which brings waves of shame and fear. The mental health referral can't come soon enough. I'm scared of relapsing into restriction once I feel 'better.'

Adherence: Diet 95% - I hit or exceeded the 2,000 kcal minimum every day, averaging 2,300 kcal (93% of the 2,458 target, but above medical minimum). Protein averaged 155g (84% of target - much better than last week's 39%). Workouts: 0/4 (0%) but medically prohibited, so this was correct adherence to medical orders.

Barriers overcome: Financial stress reduced with brother's help. Medical guidance provided structure. Fear became motivating rather than paralyzing.

Ongoing concerns: Long recovery timeline ahead. Uncertainty about when I can train again. Fear of psychological relapse. Need to address underlying mental health issues that enabled this crisis. Medical bills still a concern but manageable with family support.

This week proved I can recover if I follow the plan. The question is whether I can maintain this when supervision decreases and old patterns try to resurface."
P05,2026-W05,28.7,29.4,85.9,2380,6.9,"Week 10 started with cautious optimism but reality hit hard. Monday's second medical follow-up brought mixed news - bloodwork improving but doctor still hesitant about exercise clearance. He saw my eagerness and warned me about rushing recovery. That stung because I KNOW he's right, but sitting still feels like going backwards.

The diet plan at 2,454 kcal felt more manageable this week compared to last week's struggle to eat enough. My appetite is genuinely returning, which is both relieving and scary - I'm terrified of overshooting and gaining fat after working so hard before the crisis. Hit around 2,380 kcal average, so 97% adherence. Protein was easier at 178g/day average. The 30 SAR daily budget stretched further now that I'm not buying random snacks out of desperation.

Workouts were the frustration point. Plan called for W25 and W21 sessions 4x/week, but I'm STILL not cleared for resistance training. Did walking only - 25-30 minutes on Mon/Wed/Fri/Sat at moderate pace. It's something, but watching the program slip further away is mentally draining. That's 0/4 actual workout adherence again, though I'm complying with medical orders.

Sleep averaged 6.9 hours, slight improvement. Still waking up anxious about 'wasting time' but the exhaustion isn't as bone-deep anymore. Brother checked in twice this week - once supportive, once clearly frustrated I'm not 'fixed' yet. Told him recovery isn't linear and he backed off.

Mental health intake appointment happened Thursday. Therapist was... intense. Lots of questions about control, body image, self-worth. She used the term 'maladaptive coping' and suddenly everything felt too real. Agreed to weekly sessions but I'm not sure I'm ready to unpack everything. Baby steps.

Physically, I feel stronger than Week 9 but nowhere near normal. Gained another 0.8kg, mostly continued rehydration and digestive normalization. Muscle feels slightly fuller but that's probably just glycogen. The mirror shows someone who looks less skeletal but still depleted. 

The hardest part? Patience. Every day not training feels like muscle wasting away, even though logically I know rest IS the treatment right now. My baseline adherence propensity (0.55) kept trying to sabotage me - wanted to sneak in push-ups or skip meals to 'make up' for forced inactivity. The medical fear and family accountability are the only things keeping me compliant.

Doctor scheduled ANOTHER follow-up for Week 11 with potential training clearance if liver enzymes normalize. Crossing fingers but trying not to hope too hard. At least I'm not in crisis anymore. That's something."
P05,2026-W06,28.5,29.6,86.3,2420,7.1,"Week 11 complete. This was probably the hardest week mentally since the crisis started. I'm physically feeling better - energy is good, I look less like a skeleton, the shakes are basically gone - but my head is a complete mess. Monday's follow-up was devastating. Doctor said bloodwork is 'improving' but still won't clear me for resistance training. Another week of just walking. I wanted to scream. The rational part of me knows I crashed hard and need time, but the other part is panicking about losing everything I built.

I stuck to the diet plan all seven days, averaged around 2,420 calories which hit the target almost perfectly. Protein was consistent at 180g daily. But eating this much while NOT training feels wrong in my gut. I keep calculating how much fat I'm gaining, running the numbers in my head during meals. My therapist (second session Wednesday) called this 'catastrophizing' and pointed out I'm actually still underweight for my height, but the fear is real. I can see my abs fading and it triggers something.

Walking compliance was 100% - Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday like prescribed, 25-30 minutes each time. But it feels like nothing. I caught myself adding an extra 10 minutes on Saturday and immediately felt guilty, like I was cheating the medical orders. Then felt stupid for feeling guilty about WALKING. My brain is exhausting.

Thursday I almost broke. Found myself in the apartment complex gym at 11pm, just standing there looking at the barbell. Didn't touch it, but I wanted to so badly. Texted my brother instead of lifting - he called immediately and talked me down. He said 'you almost died, idiot, a few more weeks won't kill you but lifting might.' He's right but I hate it.

Sleep averaged 7.1 hours this week, best since before the crisis. Fewer anxiety dreams. Appetite is fully back - actually felt hungry before meals instead of forcing food. That should feel like progress but it scares me too. Therapy is helping me see these thought patterns but not yet changing them.

Weight went up again to 86.3kg. I know intellectually this is good - rehydration, tissue repair, glycogen restoration. But seeing that number climb while sedentary makes my chest tight. Body composition is probably shifting the right direction (more muscle hydration, less severe deficit) but I can't see it, just the scale number.

The positive: my coordination is back to normal, I can focus for longer periods, my skin looks healthy instead of grey, I'm not freezing all the time. These are real improvements. My resting heart rate normalized to low 60s instead of the scary 40s. Bloodwork showed liver enzymes almost normal, testosterone rising but still low. Doctor says if next Monday's labs are clean, I MIGHT get cleared for bodyweight exercises - pushups, air squats, that level. Not the program, but something.

I'm complying because I'm genuinely afraid of ending up back in that place, but the baseline part of me that doesn't stick to plans is fighting hard. Only external accountability is keeping me on track - brother's check-ins, therapy appointments, doctor visits, knowing I have to report honestly. Without that structure I'd have already done something stupid.

Three more days until next medical check. Trying to focus on that potential clearance instead of the frustration. Budget held fine at 30 SAR/day, meal prep is routine now. Physically recovering, mentally struggling, but still moving forward I guess."
P05,2026-W07,28.4,29.7,86.5,2510,7.3,"Week 12 started with the medical follow-up I've been anxiously waiting for. Monday's bloodwork came back - liver enzymes normalized, testosterone still climbing but not optimal yet. The doctor gave me conditional clearance for bodyweight exercises only, no weights still. I should feel relieved, but honestly I'm terrified. What if I push too hard? What if I don't push hard enough and lose everything I had?

The first bodyweight session (W25 modified) on Monday was humbling and emotional. I could barely do 8 proper push-ups when I used to rep out 30+ easily. My legs shook during bodyweight squats. But I finished it, and my brother was there watching to make sure I didn't go rogue. Tuesday I walked instead of the scheduled W21 because I was genuinely sore and didn't want to risk it.

Wednesday's W25 session went slightly better - 10 push-ups this time. I'm tracking every rep obsessively, which my therapist pointed out Thursday is a control behavior. She's right, but I can't stop. The body image stuff is getting worse. I look in the mirror and see someone soft and undefined, even though rationally I know I'm recovering from near-organ failure and should look exactly like this.

Thursday I was supposed to do W21 but I made an excuse about fatigue and just walked. Honestly, I think I was scared of how weak I'd feel again. Friday I pushed through another W25 - 12 push-ups, small victory. Saturday was supposed to be W21 but I substituted walking again, telling myself I was being 'cautious' but really I was avoiding the discomfort.

The diet adherence stayed strong - 2,510 kcal average, protein on point at 185g daily. But every meal feels like a mental battle. I'm eating maintenance calories while feeling weak and looking soft, and my brain keeps screaming that I'm just getting fat. I know it's irrational. The scale barely moved (86.5kg, +0.2kg), and my therapist says that's perfect. But the distortions are loud.

Sleep improved to 7.3 hours average. My brother checked in 4 times this week, including staying for two workout sessions. I'm compliant on paper - 2 out of 4 prescribed workouts completed as bodyweight modifications, 2 substituted with walking. That's 50% adherence, which given my 0.55 baseline propensity and the psychological warfare I'm experiencing, feels like both a victory and a failure.

The fear is still keeping me somewhat in line, but I can feel my old patterns creeping back - the rationalization, the 'just this once' thinking, the avoidance. Week 13 I need to hit all 4 sessions, even if they're hard. Even if I'm weak. Especially because I'm weak."
P05,2026-W08,28.4,29.9,87.1,2641,7.5,"Week 13 complete. This week felt like walking a tightrope between physical progress and mental deterioration. I'm stronger - objectively, measurably stronger - but I can't stop catastrophizing about how I look. The mirror feels like an enemy.

Monday's workout was good. W25 bodyweight session, hit 14 push-ups in the first set, up from 12 last week. My brother was there supervising, which helped me push through the discomfort of feeling weak. But afterward, I spent 20 minutes body-checking in the bathroom mirror, pinching at my sides, convinced I'm getting fat during recovery. Rationally, I know 86.7kg is still 10kg above crisis weight. Emotionally, every kilogram feels like failure.

Tuesday I was supposed to do W21 but substituted a 45-minute walk instead. Told myself it was 'active recovery' and 'listening to my body,' but my therapist would call that avoidance. The truth? I was scared of feeling weak again. The walk felt safer, more controllable. I tracked every step obsessively - 6,847 steps exactly.

Wednesday's W25 session I did alone. Mistake. Without accountability, I cut it short after the main circuit, skipping the finisher. Hit 15 push-ups though, which should feel like victory but instead triggered anxiety about whether I'm recovering 'fast enough.' Spent the evening calculating how long until I'm back to pre-crisis strength, spiraling into worst-case scenarios.

Thursday was therapy. Fourth session. We talked about the body-checking, the obsessive tracking, the avoidance patterns. She used the term 'body dysmorphia' directly for the first time. I intellectually understand what she's saying - that my perception is distorted, that the eating disorder cognitions are separate from the physical reality - but I can't *feel* it. The fear feels so real. She suggested we discuss medication options if things don't improve. That scared me more than it should have.

Friday's W21 session I actually completed fully. Brother was there again. 20 bodyweight squats felt easier than two weeks ago. Lunges didn't make me dizzy. Plank hold hit 45 seconds. Physical progress is undeniable, but I felt disconnected from it, like watching someone else's body improve. Ate my full 2,650 calories that day but felt guilty about every bite past 2,400.

Saturday I skipped the workout entirely. Just... couldn't. Woke up, looked in the mirror, felt disgusted, and the thought of exercising felt overwhelming. Went for another walk instead - 8,200 steps, told my brother I was 'being cautious' about overtraining. He didn't buy it but didn't push. I know this is the 0.55 adherence propensity reasserting itself. The medical fear that drove compliance in weeks 9-11 is fading, and my baseline patterns are coming back.

Sunday's W25 was partial. Did the warm-up and main circuit but quit before the finisher. Hit 16 push-ups in the first set - a new post-crisis high - but couldn't celebrate it. Just felt angry that 16 is still pathetic compared to where I was.

Diet adherence remained perfect on paper - 2,641 kcal daily average, 196g protein. Seven days of hitting targets. But the psychological experience of eating is getting worse, not better. I'm eating out of fear (medical consequences) and compliance (therapy homework), not from any healthy relationship with food. Every meal involves mental negotiation. Every snack triggers guilt that I have to logic my way through.

Sleep improved to 7.5 hours average, which is objectively good. But I'm waking up anxious, immediately body-checking before even getting out of bed. The first thought most mornings is dread about what I'll see in the mirror.

Weight crept up to 87.1kg by week's end (+0.6kg). Muscle mass estimate 29.9kg (+0.2kg). Fat percentage holding at 28.4%. The numbers say recovery is progressing appropriately. My brain says I'm losing control, getting fat, failing.

Completed 2.5 out of 4 prescribed workouts (62.5% adherence, slightly above my 0.55 baseline but below the 75-100% I maintained during acute crisis). The trajectory is clear: as physical danger recedes, psychological issues intensify, and adherence declines toward baseline propensity.

Protective factors: therapy engagement, brother's support (probably prevented complete workout abandonment), bloodwork continues improving (testosterone rising per Monday's follow-up), visible strength gains (8→16 push-ups over three weeks). Risk factors: body dysmorphia intensifying, avoidance patterns solidifying, emotional eating compliance weakening, baseline low adherence reasserting, fear-based motivation fading.

I'm physically healthier than I've been in months. Mentally, I feel like I'm sliding backward. The gap between objective progress and subjective experience is widening. My therapist says this is common in eating disorder recovery - the physical healing can outpace the psychological healing, creating cognitive dissonance. Understanding that doesn't make it less terrifying.

Next week needs to address the avoidance directly. Can't keep substituting walks for prescribed workouts. Need to discuss medication options seriously. Need to find motivation beyond medical fear before adherence collapses completely."
P05,2026-W09,28.3,30,87.6,2547,7.4,"Week 14 complete. This felt like watching myself slide backward in slow motion. Started strong Monday with W25—pushed through 17 push-ups, new personal best, brother spotted me—but that victory felt hollow. Like I'm getting stronger while simultaneously falling apart mentally.

Tuesday's W21 cardio session was mechanical. Just going through motions. 28 minutes of intervals while my brain screamed that I'm still too fat, still not doing enough. The mirror at the gym lies—I see 87kg but my mind sees 95kg. Therapist called this 'dysmorphia' but knowing the term doesn't make it stop.

Wednesday I skipped entirely. Told myself I'd go after iftar but just... couldn't. Sat in my room scrolling through fitness transformations on Instagram until 11pm. That comparison trap is poison but I can't stop drinking it. Thursday tried to compensate with W25 again—only managed 14 push-ups, felt like failure despite being above my week-start baseline. 

Friday's W21 was another avoidance walk. 35 minutes of just moving to check a box. Saturday and Sunday—complete collapse. The fear that drove me through the medical crisis weeks is gone, and without it I'm just a guy with 0.55 adherence propensity staring down a program that requires 1.0.

Diet was technically perfect again—2,547 kcal average, 192g protein daily, every meal logged and measured. But I'm white-knuckling it. Every bite feels like swallowing anxiety. I've started cutting my chicken into smaller pieces so it takes longer to eat, giving me more 'control.' That's not normal. I know that's not normal.

Weight up to 87.6kg (+0.5kg). Muscle holding at 30.0kg (+0.1kg). Fat 28.3% (-0.1%). The numbers say I'm recovering perfectly. My brain says I'm getting fat and weak simultaneously. The gap between objective reality and subjective experience is a canyon now.

Therapist wants to start medication next session. I'm scared of it but also scared of where this is heading without intervention. Brother noticed I've been quieter, asked if I'm okay. Lied and said I'm fine. 

Completed 2.5/4 workouts (62.5%). That's above my baseline propensity but feels like failure compared to the 75-80% weeks when panic was driving me. The crisis-motivation is fading and I don't have healthy motivation to replace it with. Just fear of food, fear of mirrors, fear of becoming the person I was at 118kg.

Sleep averaged 7.4 hours but quality is shit. Wake up at 5am with my heart racing, thinking about the day's calories before I'm even conscious. That's not recovery—that's just a different kind of sick.

Physically I'm rebuilding. Psychologically I'm collapsing. And I don't know which one wins."

The chicken kabsa took more effort than expected with my beginner cooking skills, so I simplified it a few times or grabbed something quicker. The calorie target felt high for fat loss, so I naturally ate a bit less on some days. Workouts were tough - the advanced level programs were way above my beginner fitness level. I had to scale back weights significantly and couldn't complete all sets. My shoulders were really sore after the upper body day. Managed 3 out of the planned 4 workout days because I needed extra recovery time. Sleep stayed consistent around 7 hours. I'm seeing the scale move slightly which is encouraging, but I know I need to find a better balance between the workout intensity and my current ability."

The meal prep was harder than I expected as a beginner cook - the Harees took forever to make properly and I ended up buying pre-made versions a few times. The tahini snack was easy though. I hit maybe 55-60% of my calorie targets most days because the portions felt huge and I wasn't always hungry enough. The workouts were really intense for my beginner level - the advanced upper body and legs sessions left me extremely sore for 2-3 days each. I could only complete about 60% of the exercises at lower weights. Sleep stayed pretty consistent around 7 hours. I did notice feeling a bit leaner by the end of the week and my energy improved after day 3.

The chicken kabsa was delicious and filling - I actually looked forward to lunch every day. I managed to hit the gym all 5 days as planned, though I'll admit Thursday's back workout was tough after shoulders on Wednesday. The advanced workouts are challenging but I can feel myself getting stronger. I did skip the 4th meal twice this week (Monday and Friday) because I just wasn't hungry enough after dinner, so my actual calorie intake was probably around 1950 kcal on those days. The jareesh is hearty but sometimes felt too heavy before bed. My energy levels during cardio intervals have noticeably improved - I'm recovering faster between sets. Sleep was pretty consistent around 7-8 hours most nights, though I stayed up late on Saturday catching up with friends. Overall adherence was about 80% - I'm proud of sticking to the workout schedule completely!"
P06,2025-W47,27,20.3,59.1,1985,7.3,"Week 47 was a solid week overall! I managed to stick to my endurance-focused program pretty well, completing 4 out of 5 scheduled workouts. Monday's HIIT session (W03) felt great - I'm really noticing improvements in my cardiovascular capacity. Wednesday's circuit training (W07) pushed me hard, and I felt that satisfying burn in my legs and core. 

I had to skip Friday's workout (W15) because I had a late work commitment and by the time I got home around 9 PM, I was just too exhausted. I made up for it mentally by doing some light stretching before bed. Saturday and Sunday's workouts (W21 and back to basics) went well, though Sunday I felt a bit sluggish in the morning.

Diet-wise, I'd say I hit about 80% adherence. My budget of 50 SAR per day was mostly sufficient, though I did have to make some compromises. I meal-prepped on Sunday which helped a lot during the busy weekdays. Tuesday and Thursday I skipped my afternoon snack because I got caught up in meetings and honestly forgot to eat until dinner. On Wednesday, I went out with friends and had a shawarma wrap that definitely pushed me over my calorie target - probably around 2400 kcal that day. But I balanced it out Thursday by keeping things lighter.

Breakfast was usually overnight oats with banana and a bit of honey, or scrambled eggs with whole wheat toast. Lunch was typically grilled chicken with brown rice and vegetables, or a tuna salad. Dinners varied - I made a nice salmon with sweet potato on Monday, lentil curry on Thursday, and beef stir-fry on Saturday. The timing issue I noted last week is still there - I'm eating dinner around 9 PM most nights which isn't ideal.

Sleep averaged around 7.3 hours this week, which is close to my usual. I had one rough night on Thursday (only 6.5 hours) because I was stressed about a project deadline, but otherwise maintained my routine pretty well.

Physically, I'm feeling stronger and my endurance is definitely improving. I can sustain higher intensity intervals for longer without feeling completely wiped. My legs felt a bit sore mid-week after the circuit training, but it was good soreness, not injury-related. Energy levels were consistent except for that Friday crash.

One challenge this week was staying hydrated - I need to be more conscious about drinking water throughout the day, not just during workouts. Also, I'm noticing I need to plan better for those busy days when I might miss a meal or workout.

Overall, I'm happy with the progress. The scale showed a tiny drop, which I'm attributing to better consistency with cardio and keeping my diet mostly on track. My clothes are fitting a bit better, especially around my waist. Looking forward to maintaining this momentum next week and maybe adjusting that dinner timing!"
P06,2025-W48,26.8,20.4,59,2115,7.2,"Completed the week with mixed results but overall feeling positive about my progress. Started strong on Monday with W03 (full body strength) - felt energized and managed all sets with good form. Tuesday's diet was spot-on with meal prep carrying over from last week. Wednesday's W07 (cardio intervals) really challenged me, but I pushed through and noticed my recovery time between intervals has improved significantly. 

Thursday I had to skip my afternoon snack due to back-to-back meetings at work, which left me pretty hungry by dinner. Ended up eating a bit more than planned - probably around 2,300 kcal for the day. Friday's W11 (circuit training) was tough on tired legs, but I modified a few exercises and still got a solid workout. The weekend was where things got tricky - Saturday I completely missed W15 because a friend's birthday dinner ran late and I was exhausted. Felt guilty but also recognized I needed the rest.

Sunday I made up for it with W21 (endurance run) and actually felt amazing - my longest continuous run yet at a comfortable pace. Meal prep for the upcoming week went well, though I had to substitute chicken thighs for breast to stay within budget. Overall adherence was around 75% on workouts (4/5 completed) and maybe 78% on diet. Late dinners continue to be an issue - averaged around 8:45 PM most nights due to work schedule.

Physically, I'm noticing better cardiovascular endurance and my clothes fit slightly better around the waist. Some muscle soreness in quads and glutes mid-week but nothing concerning. Sleep was decent except for Wednesday night when work stress kept me up - only got about 6.5 hours. Hydration definitely needs work - I'm forgetting my water bottle too often. Budget held up okay with some creative substitutions. Ready to tackle next week with renewed focus on consistency and earlier meal timing."
P06,2025-W49,26.5,20.5,58.7,2087,7,"Week 2025-W49 was challenging but productive overall. Coming off last week's momentum, I felt stronger in my endurance workouts, especially during W21 which I managed to complete twice this week. The diet was harder to stick to than expected - my budget really started to bite mid-week when I had to choose between quality protein and staying under 50 SAR/day. I ended up buying more eggs and canned tuna instead of fresh chicken breast. 

Monday's W03 workout felt great - my recovery from last week was solid. Tuesday I nailed the diet perfectly with my meal prep, but Wednesday things got messy. I had an unexpected work meeting that ran late, so dinner was at 9:30 PM and I grabbed a shawarma (probably 150 kcal over target). Thursday's W11 workout was tough; my legs were still feeling it from Monday and I had to modify some exercises. 

Friday was my best day - hit W15 in the morning before work, stayed on track with meals, and felt energized. The weekend was mixed: Saturday's W21 was excellent, I really pushed myself and felt that runner's high. But Sunday I completely missed my planned W07 workout because I was exhausted and slept in until 10 AM. I also went out for coffee with friends and ended up having a pastry I hadn't planned for.

Hydration was better this week - I kept a water bottle at my desk and managed about 2.5L most days. Sleep averaged around 7 hours, though Wednesday night was rough (only 6 hours) because I was stressed about work deadlines. My late dinner habit continues to be an issue - averaged 8:30 PM this week.

Physically, I notice my endurance is definitely improving. Stairs at work don't wind me anymore, and my resting heart rate feels lower. Some persistent DOMS in my quads and glutes, especially mid-week. Weight feels about the same, maybe slightly down. My jeans fit a tiny bit looser around the waist.

The 50 SAR daily budget is really tight for hitting 130g protein. I spent about 340 SAR this week on groceries, which is just under budget, but it meant a lot of repetitive meals: oatmeal breakfasts, egg-based lunches, and chicken thighs (cheaper than breast) for dinner. I'm getting tired of the same foods but I know it's working."
P06,2025-W50,26.3,20.6,58.5,2065,6.9,"Week 50 was a mixed bag for me. I started strong on Monday with meal prep done on Sunday evening - lots of rice, chicken thighs (cheaper than breast but higher fat), and roasted veggies. The budget is really tight at 50 SAR/day, so I'm relying heavily on eggs, canned tuna, and lentils for protein. I managed to hit 4 out of 5 workouts which I'm proud of, though I had to skip Friday's W15 session because I stayed up late Thursday finishing a work project and only got 5.5 hours of sleep.

The endurance workouts are definitely getting easier - I noticed on Wednesday's W11 session that my recovery between intervals felt faster, and my heart rate wasn't spiking as high. That felt like real progress! But my legs were absolutely screaming by Thursday from the accumulated volume. DOMS hit hard in my quads and glutes.

Diet-wise, I'd say I was around 74% adherent this week. Tuesday I went over by about 200 kcal because a colleague brought homemade kunafa to work and I couldn't resist. Saturday I had a late dinner with friends (we went out around 9:30 PM) and I definitely overate - probably closer to 2400 kcal that day. The late eating is still a problem; I'm averaging dinner around 8:45 PM because of my work schedule.

Budget pressure is real. I'm eating a lot of the same meals - egg scrambles for breakfast, tuna or chicken with rice for lunch, and similar for dinner. It's getting monotonous but it's what I can afford. I did splurge 8 SAR on a cappuccino mid-week when I was exhausted, which cut into my food budget.

Sleep averaged just under 7 hours - not terrible but not optimal. Wednesday night I only got 6 hours because of work stress, and Friday I overslept to 8.5 hours trying to catch up. Hydration was better this week, consistently hitting 2.5L most days.

Overall, I feel like I'm maintaining my fitness level and maybe seeing small endurance gains, but I'm not losing fat as fast as I'd hoped. The budget constraints and late eating are definitely holding me back. My energy levels are okay but not great - probably need more sleep and better meal timing."
P06,2025-W51,26.1,20.65,58.3,2087,6.9,"Week 51 was a mixed bag for me. I managed to stick to the workout schedule pretty well, hitting 4 out of 5 sessions, which I'm proud of considering my energy levels weren't always optimal. The missed Friday workout (W15) happened again - I stayed late at work Thursday night finishing a project deadline, got only 5.5 hours of sleep, and just couldn't drag myself to the gym Friday morning. I'm noticing a pattern here that I need to address.

Diet-wise, I averaged around 74% adherence, which matches my typical propensity. Monday through Wednesday were solid - I meal-prepped on Sunday evening with my usual rotation: scrambled eggs with frozen veggies for breakfast, canned tuna with rice and cucumber for lunch, and chicken thighs with lentils and steamed broccoli for dinner. The monotony is definitely getting to me though. By Wednesday evening I was genuinely tired of eating the same things, but my 50 SAR daily budget doesn't leave much room for variety, especially with prices the way they are.

Tuesday I had a team lunch at work - someone's birthday - and I couldn't really say no without being rude. I estimated I went about 180 kcal over target with the extra rice and dessert. Then Saturday, my friends insisted on going out for dinner. I tried to make reasonable choices, ordering grilled chicken with vegetables, but the restaurant portions were huge and I know the cooking oil added up. I estimate I exceeded by about 350 kcal that day.

The workouts themselves felt good. W03 on Monday was tough after the weekend, but I pushed through. W07 Tuesday was actually one of my better sessions - I felt strong and my endurance during the cardio intervals was noticeably better than a few weeks ago. W11 Wednesday left me with significant DOMS in my quads and glutes that lasted through Friday. That delayed onset muscle soreness was intense but also satisfying - proof I'm working hard. W21 on Saturday was challenging after Friday's poor sleep and the accumulated fatigue, but I completed it.

Sleep averaged 6.9 hours again. I got my usual 7-7.5 hours Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday. Wednesday I only managed 6 hours due to work stress and racing thoughts about the deadline. Friday I crashed hard and got 8.5 hours, which felt amazing and much needed. Saturday was back to 7 hours.

I'm continuing to see subtle endurance improvements. During W11's cardio segments, I maintained a higher intensity for longer without feeling completely gassed. My resting heart rate in the morning seems slightly lower too, though I haven't been tracking it formally. The scale showed a small drop, which I think is mostly water weight and maybe a tiny bit of fat loss. My clothes fit about the same.

Hydration was consistent at about 2.5L daily. I had one unplanned expense - a 9 SAR coffee on Thursday afternoon when I was desperately trying to stay awake at work. I felt guilty about it budget-wise, but I genuinely needed the caffeine boost.

The late dinners continue to be an issue. I'm averaging 8:45 PM, with the latest being 9:15 PM on Thursday (after that late work night). I know this isn't ideal for sleep quality or digestion, but my work schedule makes it difficult to eat earlier. I did have some digestive discomfort Sunday evening - mild bloating and gas - which I'm attributing to the increased lentil consumption in my meal prep. Maybe I need to introduce them more gradually or try different preparation methods.

Overall, I'm maintaining my trajectory but not making dramatic progress. The endurance gains are encouraging and keep me motivated. I need to figure out how to protect my sleep better, especially before Friday workouts, and maybe find ways to add variety to my meals without breaking the budget. The social eating situations are tricky - I don't want to isolate myself, but they do throw off my nutrition targets. I'm learning that consistency is hard when life gets in the way, but I'm doing my best with the constraints I have."
P06,2025-W52,25.9,20.75,58.1,2045,6.4,"Week 52 was a mixed bag - I managed to hit 4 out of 5 planned workouts which felt like a win given the holiday distractions. Started strong Monday with W03, felt energized despite the 6.5 hours of sleep. Tuesday's W07 was tough - my quads were still complaining from last week's W11, but I pushed through. Skipped W11 on Wednesday because I got pulled into an unexpected work meeting that ran until 7 PM, and by the time I got home and ate, I was too mentally drained. Thursday's W15 went surprisingly well - I think my endurance is genuinely improving because the cardio intervals felt more manageable than they did a month ago. Saturday's W21 was brutal but satisfying.

Diet-wise, I stayed pretty close to target most days, averaging around 2,045 kcal daily. The repetitive meals are really getting to me though - I'm so tired of the same chicken thighs and rice combo. I tried to spice things up with different seasonings but it's still boring. Wednesday I went over by about 220 kcal because I was stress-eating after that work situation, grabbed an extra snack of nuts and dates. Friday was a disaster - went out with friends for an early holiday dinner and completely blew past my target by about 380 kcal. The restaurant meal was delicious but super oily and salty. I felt bloated all of Saturday morning.

Budget held at 48.7 SAR/day average, which is good. I did splurge 15 SAR on Friday's coffee meetup before the dinner, but otherwise stuck to my usual groceries. The late dinners continue to be an issue - averaged 8:50 PM this week, with Thursday being 9:30 PM because of meal prep delays. I really need to figure out how to eat earlier, I think it's affecting my sleep quality.

Sleep was rough this week - averaged only 6.4 hours. Sunday night I only got 5.8 hours because I was anxious about the week ahead. Tuesday was 6 hours, Thursday was 5.5 hours due to a noisy neighbor situation, and even my best night (Saturday) was only 7.5 hours. I can feel the fatigue accumulating. My body feels tired even when I wake up.

Physically, I'm noticing some positive changes. My resting heart rate in the mornings continues to trend down slightly - it was averaging around 64 bpm this week versus 66-67 a few weeks ago. During W15 and W21, I definitely felt stronger in the cardio portions, less out of breath. My legs feel more solid, especially my quads and glutes. DOMS was present but less severe than previous weeks, mostly just Tuesday and Wednesday from Monday's workout. Weight feels about the same, maybe down very slightly? My jeans fit a tiny bit looser around the waist but that could be wishful thinking.

The digestive issues from lentils last week didn't repeat, thankfully. I reduced my portion size and that seemed to help. Hydration was good, maintained around 2.4-2.6L daily. One weird thing - I had a headache Wednesday afternoon that might have been dehydration or stress, hard to tell.

Overall adherence was probably around 76% - hit 80% on workouts (4/5), about 73% on diet considering the Friday overage and Wednesday slip. The monotony is my biggest challenge right now. I need to find a way to make meals more interesting without blowing my budget or adding too much prep time. Also really need to prioritize sleep better - 6.4 hours is not enough and I can feel it affecting my recovery and mood."
P06,2026-W01,25.5,20.85,57.8,2147,6.1,"Week 1 of 2026 was a mixed bag. I started strong on Monday with W03 feeling energized, but Tuesday's W07 hit harder than expected - probably the sleep debt catching up. Wednesday I completely missed W11 again because of another late work situation (seems to be a pattern now). I tried to compensate Thursday with W15 but my legs were heavy from accumulated fatigue. Friday was a rest day but I went out with friends again and totally blew my calorie budget at this new Persian place - the food was incredible but I felt bloated all Saturday morning. Saturday's W21 workout was decent despite the bloating, though I had to push through some nausea in the first 15 minutes. Sunday was rest and meal prep, but honestly I'm so tired of eating the same grilled chicken and rice combinations. I need to find new recipes that don't require more budget or time.

Positives: My resting heart rate is still trending down (averaged 62 bpm this week!), and I definitely notice my endurance improving during the cardio intervals. My jeans are noticeably looser and I had to tighten my belt one notch. A coworker even commented that I look 'leaner' which felt amazing.

Negatives: Sleep is still terrible - averaged only 6.1 hours this week with two really bad nights (5.2 hrs Tuesday after staying up worrying about a project, and 5.4 hrs Thursday when my neighbor had people over until 2 AM). The fatigue is real and I can feel it affecting my workout quality. Diet adherence was only about 74% - I stress-ate on Tuesday evening (extra peanut butter and crackers, probably +180 kcal) and then Friday's restaurant meal was at least +450 kcal over target. Wednesday I also grabbed an expensive latte (18 SAR!) because I was exhausted. Budget averaged 51.2 SAR/day so slightly over.

The meal monotony is becoming a serious mental barrier. I'm eating chicken, rice, and broccoli for the 4th week in a row and I'm just... over it. I need variety but I don't have the energy to experiment with new recipes after work, especially with these late dinners (still averaging 8:45 PM). I'm also noticing I'm hungrier in the evenings, probably because of the sleep deprivation affecting my hunger hormones.

Physically I feel like I'm making progress, but mentally I'm struggling with the routine. Need to figure out the sleep situation and add some variety to meals without breaking the budget."
P06,2026-W02,25.1,21,57.5,2038,6.2,"Week 2 was honestly a mixed bag. Started strong on Monday with W03 workout - felt energized and my endurance is definitely improving. I can feel my cardiovascular capacity building, which is exactly what I'm aiming for. Tuesday's W07 session was tough though. I was running on 5.8 hours of sleep and could feel the fatigue in my legs from the start. Still pushed through but had to scale back intensity slightly.

Wednesday was supposed to be W11 but I missed it again - this time because I had a headache that started Tuesday night and lingered. I think it's the combination of poor sleep and work stress. I'm noticing a pattern here that needs addressing. Thursday's W15 workout felt redemptive - got 6.5 hours of sleep the night before and it made ALL the difference. My pace was consistent and I felt strong throughout.

Diet-wise, I tried to add more variety after identifying meal monotony as a barrier last week. Made a new lentil and vegetable curry on Sunday that I portioned out, and it helped break up the routine. Budget stayed tighter this week at 49.8 SAR/day average - learned my lesson about those coffee shop visits. However, Friday night I went out with friends again (seems to be becoming a pattern) and exceeded my calorie target by about 380 kcal. The social pressure is real, and I don't want to be 'that person' who doesn't participate.

Saturday's W21 workout was challenging after Friday's indulgence - felt sluggish and bloated for the first 15 minutes but pushed through. My adherence this week was about 76% on diet and 4 out of 5 workouts again. Sleep averaged 6.2 hours which is marginally better but still not ideal. I'm setting an alarm for 10:30 PM this coming week to force myself to start winding down earlier.

Positive notes: My resting heart rate is now consistently in the low 60s (61 bpm average this week), and I ran a 5K time trial on Saturday that was 47 seconds faster than three weeks ago. A coworker commented that I look 'leaner' which was a nice confidence boost. The belt notch thing is real - I'm comfortably wearing it one notch tighter now. Body composition changes are definitely happening even if the scale isn't moving dramatically.

Challenges: Late dinners are still happening (average 8:35 PM this week), sleep debt is accumulating, and I need a better strategy for social eating situations. Also noticing that my Wednesday workouts are becoming the consistent miss - might need to move that rest day officially to Wednesday and shift the workout to Sunday instead."
P06,2026-W03,24.8,21.1,57.3,2087,6.3,"Week 3 felt like a mixed bag—I managed to hit 4 out of 5 workouts again, which is becoming my pattern, but I'm frustrated that Wednesday continues to be my Achilles heel. The W11 workout got skipped again due to a combination of poor sleep Tuesday night (only 5.5 hours) and a work deadline that pushed into the evening. I'm starting to think I need to either move Wednesday workouts to morning or accept that midweek is just tough for me right now.

The workouts I did complete felt strong though! Monday's W03 interval session was solid—I felt energized and my recovery between intervals was noticeably better than last week. Thursday's W15 tempo run was challenging but I maintained pace better than expected. Saturday's W21 long run (90 minutes) was actually enjoyable despite some initial stiffness. My legs felt heavy the first 20 minutes but then I found my rhythm.

Diet-wise, I was more consistent this week—around 82% adherence, which I'm proud of. I meal-prepped Sunday evening which made weekday eating so much easier. The lentil and quinoa bowls were filling and hit my protein targets without breaking the budget. I stayed within 48.7 SAR/day average. However, I did have a slip-up on Friday night again (seems to be my pattern)—went out with friends and had shawarma with extra garlic sauce and shared fries. Probably added 300+ extra calories, but I didn't feel as guilty this time because I'd been so consistent during the week.

Sleep is still my biggest struggle. Averaged 6.3 hours this week, which is marginally better but still not enough. I can feel it in my recovery—my resting heart rate was slightly elevated at 63 bpm average. Wednesday and Sunday nights were particularly bad (5.5 and 5.9 hours respectively). I tried going to bed earlier but my mind races with work stuff and I end up scrolling my phone. I know this is sabotaging my progress.

Physically, I'm noticing small changes. My pants fit slightly looser around the waist, and I can see a bit more definition in my shoulders and legs. The scale only moved a tiny bit, but I feel leaner. Had some mild soreness after Saturday's long run but nothing debilitating—just that satisfying muscle fatigue that tells me I'm working hard.

Hydration was good—averaged 2.6L daily. I've been adding electrolyte tabs to my water post-workout which seems to help with recovery. No headaches this week, which is a relief! Energy levels were generally stable except for Wednesday when I felt drained.

Looking ahead, I need to: 1) Figure out the Wednesday workout situation—maybe try 6:30 AM sessions? 2) Establish a better sleep routine—maybe set a phone alarm for 'start bedtime routine' at 10 PM. 3) Keep up the meal prep momentum. 4) Not beat myself up about the occasional Friday social meal—it's sustainable to have some flexibility.

Overall, I feel like I'm building good habits even if progress isn't lightning-fast. My 5K time would probably be even better now if I tested it. Endurance is definitely improving—that 90-minute run would have destroyed me two months ago."
P06,2026-W04,24.4,21.3,57.1,2038,6.4,"Week W04 felt like a consolidation week—I'm starting to see real patterns in what works and what doesn't. Monday's W03 workout went smoothly despite some residual tiredness from the weekend. I managed all five scheduled workouts this week, which is a first in a while! The Wednesday morning experiment paid off—I shifted W11 to 6:15 AM before work and it completely eliminated that midweek barrier. Yes, I had to wake at 5:45 AM which was brutal, but I felt accomplished all day and avoided the evening work conflict trap.

Tuesday's W07 session was solid. I'm noticing my intervals are getting smoother and recovery between sets feels faster. Thursday's W15 workout had me questioning my life choices during the hill repeats, but I pushed through. My legs felt heavy initially but warmed up by rep 3. Saturday's W21 long run was the highlight—10K at a comfortable pace, and I actually enjoyed the last 2K instead of just surviving them. The weather was perfect, cool morning air, and I felt strong throughout.

Diet adherence hovered around 80% this week. Meal prep Sunday evening set me up well for Mon-Thu. I made my usual chicken shawarma bowls, lentil soup, and overnight oats. Tuesday I went slightly over budget grabbing a pre-made salad at the office café (12 SAR vs my planned 8 SAR), but it saved time. Wednesday evening I was starving post-morning workout and overshot dinner by about 250 kcal—had extra hummus and pita that wasn't in the plan. Friday was predictably social—dinner with friends at a Lebanese place. I tried to be mindful, ordered grilled fish with vegetables, but the bread basket and shared appetizers probably added 400 extra kcal. Still, better than previous weeks.

Sleep remained challenging. I averaged 6.4 hours, which is a tiny improvement. The Wednesday early workout meant I went to bed at 10:15 PM Tuesday night (earlier than usual), and I actually got 7.1 hours—my best night. But Friday I stayed up until midnight and only got 5.8 hours before Saturday's long run. I felt it in my pace for the first 3K. Sunday night was also rough at 6.0 hours due to some work stress about an upcoming presentation.

Budget stayed on track at 49.2 SAR/day average. The Tuesday café overage was offset by a very economical Thursday (homemade everything, ~38 SAR). Friday's social meal was about 65 SAR, but I'd budgeted for a higher day knowing I had plans.

Physically, I'm definitely seeing changes. My work pants are looser around the waist, and I caught myself in the gym mirror Thursday noticing actual shoulder definition. My quads look more defined too. The scale hasn't moved dramatically, but something is shifting composition-wise. Energy levels were good except for Saturday morning grogginess. No headaches this week. Resting heart rate averaged 61 bpm—down from last week's 63, probably thanks to better sleep Wednesday and consistent training.

Mild soreness Sunday and Monday in my calves and glutes from Saturday's long run, but nothing that impacted movement. I foam-rolled Sunday evening and that helped. Hydration stayed strong at 2.7L daily average. I'm really dialing in the electrolyte timing post-workout.

Mentally, I feel more confident. Completing all five workouts was a huge win. The Wednesday morning shift feels sustainable if I can protect that Tuesday bedtime. I'm less anxious about Friday social eating—I'm learning to enjoy it as part of life rather than a failure. Next week I want to focus on getting to bed by 10:30 PM at least four nights and maybe experimenting with a post-dinner walk to improve digestion and sleep quality."
P06,2026-W05,24,21.4,56.7,1680,6.3,"Week 5 presented a mixed picture. I maintained the 5-workout schedule again, which felt empowering, but the diet target of only 488 kcal daily was immediately recognized as a data error—I interpreted this as my deficit target and ate my maintenance minus ~500 kcal (approximately 1650-1700 kcal daily). The Wednesday morning workout slot continues to be a game-changer, though I struggled with Tuesday night sleep discipline twice this week.

Monday started strong with W03 workout and solid meal prep. Tuesday's W07 session went well, but I stayed up until 11:15 PM (missed my 10:30 target) catching up on messages, which made Wednesday's 5:45 AM wake-up brutal. Still completed W11 morning workout but felt sluggish. Thursday W15 session was excellent—best energy of the week. Saturday's W21 long run was challenging; I started later (7:30 AM vs 6:45 AM goal) due to Friday late night (midnight bedtime, social gathering). Legs felt heavy first 3km but found rhythm.

Diet adherence hovered around 76-78%. The extremely low calorie target in the data seemed wrong, so I followed my established pattern from previous weeks. Monday-Thursday meal prep kept me on track. Wednesday post-morning-workout hunger remained an issue—added an extra snack (dates and almonds, ~180 kcal). Friday evening I attended a birthday dinner (Indian restaurant), estimated +450 kcal over target with naan and biryani, though I chose tandoori chicken as protein. Saturday I was more conservative to balance out. Sunday slight overshoot (+150 kcal) with family lunch.

Budget averaged 51.2 SAR/day, slightly over target. Friday dinner was 72 SAR (split appetizer helped), offset by Monday-Thursday economy (avg 43 SAR). Weekend grocery run was efficient.

Sleep averaged 6.3 hours—slight regression from last week's 6.4. Best night was Thursday (7.0 hours), worst was Friday (5.5 hours, social event). I managed 10:30 PM bedtime only twice (Monday and Thursday). Tuesday and Sunday were 11:15 PM, Friday midnight, Wednesday 10:45 PM, Saturday 11:00 PM. The Tuesday bedtime continues to be my Achilles heel for Wednesday morning workouts.

Physically, I'm noticing continued body composition changes. Jeans are looser in the waist, and I can see more definition in my shoulders and quads. Resting heart rate averaged 60 bpm (down from 61 bpm). Mild DOMS in glutes Sunday-Monday after Saturday's long run. No headaches this week. Energy was stable except Wednesday and Saturday mornings when sleep was short.

I experimented with post-dinner walks three times (Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday) for 15-20 minutes. Genuinely seemed to help with digestion and made me feel more relaxed before bed, though it didn't translate to earlier bedtimes consistently.

Psychologically, completing 10 consecutive workouts over two weeks (5/5 both W04 and W05) has built real momentum. I feel athletic and capable. The Friday social eating was guilt-free—I'm learning to balance enjoyment with overall weekly patterns. However, I'm frustrated with my Tuesday night discipline. I know Wednesday morning workouts require Tuesday 10:30 PM bedtimes, yet I've only achieved it 50% of the time.

Weight dropped slightly, likely a combination of improved consistency, training load, and being mindful of portions despite the confusing diet data. Body feels leaner and stronger. The endurance goal is progressing—Saturday's 8km run felt more manageable than previous long runs, even with the rough start."
P06,2026-W06,23.7,21.5,56.3,1720,6.4,"Week 2026-W06 wrapped up with a mixed bag of wins and setbacks. I'm proud I completed all 5 scheduled workouts again—that's THREE consecutive weeks now, which feels incredible for my confidence and endurance goals. The workouts themselves felt progressively stronger, especially Thursday's W15 where I hit a new pace PR on the intervals. However, I'm frustrated with myself for the Tuesday bedtime issue AGAIN. Despite flagging it as a priority last week, I stayed up until 11:30 PM on Tuesday catching up on a work project, which made Wednesday's 5:45 AM W11 workout absolutely brutal. I was dragging through the first 2km and considered skipping, but pushed through—small victory there.

Diet-wise, I'm still confused about the 515 kcal target in the plan. That can't be right, so I continued my approach from W05: aiming for ~1650 kcal daily (maintenance minus 500 kcal deficit). My adherence dropped to about 74% this week—lower than my 78% propensity and last week's 77%. Monday through Wednesday were solid with meal prep (overnight oats, grilled chicken salads, lentil soup). Thursday I had a work lunch that pushed me to ~1850 kcal (shawarma wrap, hummus, baklava—couldn't resist). Friday was disciplined to compensate. But then Sunday happened: family gathering with my aunt's homemade kabsa, kunafa dessert, and I went over by about 400 kcal. I don't feel guilty—it was worth it for the social connection—but it definitely impacted my weekly average.

Budget came in at 52.8 SAR/day average, slightly over my 50 SAR limit. Thursday's restaurant lunch cost 68 SAR, and I splurged on fresh salmon Saturday (45 SAR) thinking the omega-3s would help recovery. The rest of the week I kept it economical with eggs, chicken thighs, rice, and frozen vegetables.

Sleep remains my Achilles heel: averaged 6.4 hours, barely improved from last week's 6.3. Best night was Saturday at 7.2 hours, worst was Wednesday at 5.8 hours (thanks to Tuesday's late bedtime). I managed 10:30 PM bedtimes on Monday, Thursday, and Friday, but Tuesday (11:30 PM), Wednesday (10:50 PM), Saturday (11:15 PM), and Sunday (11:00 PM) all slipped. I NEED to address this—I can feel the cumulative fatigue affecting my morning energy and probably my recovery.

Physically, I'm noticing continued body composition changes. My jeans are definitely looser in the waist, and I can see more definition in my shoulders and quads when I flex. Weight dropped slightly this week, which aligns with my deficit goal. Resting heart rate is holding steady at 60 bpm. I had mild DOMS in my calves Monday-Tuesday after Saturday's long run, but nothing debilitating. Hydration stayed consistent at 2.5-2.7L daily.

Post-dinner walks happened 4 times this week (Mon, Tue, Thu, Sun)—hit my goal! They really do help with digestion and mental decompression. I'm making this a non-negotiable habit.

For W07, my focus is crystal clear: (1) Tuesday 10:30 PM bedtime is NON-NEGOTIABLE—I'm setting three alarms and telling my roommate to hold me accountable, (2) target 6.5+ hours sleep at least 5 nights, (3) keep diet adherence above 75% while being flexible for social events, (4) maintain the workout streak (that'll be 15 consecutive scheduled workouts!), and (5) continue post-dinner walks 4+ times. I feel strong, capable, and motivated despite the sleep struggles."
P06,2026-W07,23.3,21.7,56.1,2170,6.6,"Week 7 complete! This was a breakthrough week in many ways. I finally cracked the Tuesday bedtime issue—set three phone alarms and told my roommate to literally knock on my door at 10:15 PM. It worked! Tuesday I was in bed by 10:25 PM, which made Wednesday's W11 workout feel SO much better than last week's struggle. I hit all 5 workouts again (that's 20 consecutive scheduled sessions now!), and Thursday's W15 intervals felt like I was flying. My legs just had this spring I haven't felt before.

Diet adherence landed at 76%—slightly up from last week's 74%. I'm getting better at navigating social situations. Monday and Tuesday were perfect meal prep days, hitting right around 2050 kcal. Wednesday I went to a colleague's birthday lunch (chicken mandi, small portion of basbousa) and came in at 2180 kcal, but I planned for it by having a lighter breakfast. Thursday was solid at 2020 kcal. Friday I had a late work meeting and grabbed a quick shawarma on the way home—2240 kcal for the day, but honestly I was starving and needed the fuel before Saturday's long run.

Saturday's W21 workout was AMAZING. 90 minutes, felt strong the entire time, negative split the second half. Fueled properly beforehand with dates and labneh. Post-run I was ravenous and had a big lunch (grilled chicken, rice, salad, then some dark chocolate), came in around 2300 kcal but totally justified. Sunday was family dinner again—Mom made her special lamb kabsa and I had two servings plus a piece of qatayef. Estimated 2450 kcal for the day, but I walked 25 minutes after dinner and didn't feel guilty at all. My relationship with food is getting healthier.

Budget was 51.2 SAR/day average—just over my 50 SAR limit but way better than last week's 52.8. The Friday shawarma was 28 SAR, Saturday's post-workout groceries (chicken, vegetables, Greek yogurt) were 42 SAR, but I kept other days really economical with lentils, eggs, and frozen vegetables. I'm learning to balance the splurges.

Sleep averaged 6.6 hours—my best week yet! Hit 6.5+ hours on 5 nights (Mon 6.7, Tue 6.9, Wed 6.5, Thu 6.8, Sat 7.1). Only Friday (5.9 hrs) and Sunday (6.3 hrs) were below target, and Friday was because of that work meeting, not my fault. The Tuesday breakthrough was huge psychologically. I feel like I've finally established a sustainable rhythm.

Post-dinner walks happened 5 times this week (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Sun)—exceeded my 4+ goal! Thursday's walk was particularly nice, cooler evening, clear sky, just me and my thoughts processing the day. These walks are becoming non-negotiable for my mental health.

Body composition changes are REAL now. My jeans are noticeably looser in the waist, and I can see quad definition when I'm standing normally (not even flexing!). My shoulders look broader in the mirror. Resting heart rate dropped to 58 bpm—down from 60 last week. I feel faster, lighter, more powerful. The endurance base I'm building is translating to everyday energy levels too.

No injuries, though I had mild hip flexor tightness Friday morning (probably from Thursday's intervals), so I did extra stretching and foam rolling. Hydration stayed consistent at 2.6-2.8L daily. One weird thing: I've been craving more protein lately, especially after workouts. My body is definitely adapting.

W07 focus achieved: enforced Tuesday bedtime ✓, 6.5+ hrs sleep 5 nights ✓, 75%+ diet adherence ✓, workout streak continued ✓, post-dinner walks 4+ times ✓. I'm so proud of this week. The consistency is paying off in ways I didn't expect—not just physically, but mentally. I feel capable, disciplined, and strong. Bring on Week 8!"
P06,2026-W08,22.9,21.9,55.8,2145,6.7,"Week 8 was a solid continuation of my momentum, though not without challenges. I hit my 25-workout streak goal by completing all 5 scheduled sessions—21st through 25th consecutive workouts! That feels incredible. Monday's W03 recovery run felt easy, almost too easy, which shows my base fitness is really improving. Tuesday I enforced the 10:25 PM bedtime again using my triple alarm system, and it worked—got 6.9 hours of sleep and Wednesday's W11 tempo run was phenomenal as a result. I hit every split within 3 seconds of target pace and felt controlled throughout.

Thursday's W15 intervals were tough but rewarding. I managed all reps at prescribed pace, though my legs felt heavy in the last two. Friday I slipped on sleep (5.7 hours) because I stayed up researching protein timing strategies—ironic that optimizing one thing compromised another. Saturday's W21 long run (90 minutes) was my strongest yet. I experimented with having a protein-rich snack 90 minutes before (Greek yogurt with banana) and felt noticeably more sustained energy in the second half. Negative split again!

Diet adherence landed at 77%—a slight improvement. Daily intake averaged around 2145 kcal, which is close to my 2049 target considering my training load. Monday through Wednesday were excellent with meal prep. Thursday I had a spontaneous dinner invitation (chicken kabsa with colleagues, +220 kcal) but I balanced it by having a lighter lunch. Friday work stress led to late-night snacking (dates and nuts, +180 kcal), which I regret. Saturday post-long-run I refueled appropriately (smoothie bowl, +200 kcal—justified). Sunday was family gathering with traditional foods (lamb mandi, kunafa, +380 kcal) but I enjoyed it guilt-free and did a 30-minute evening walk.

Budget averaged 50.8 SAR/day—just barely over my 50 SAR limit but much better than recent weeks. Thursday's dinner out was 32 SAR (my contribution to shared meal), Saturday groceries were 45 SAR (stocked up on chicken breast, Greek yogurt, frozen vegetables), but other days I kept it economical with lentils, eggs, and bulk rice.

Sleep averaged 6.7 hours—my best week ever and hitting my W08 target! Five nights at 6.5+ hours: Monday 6.8, Tuesday 6.9, Wednesday 6.7, Thursday 6.6, Saturday 7.2. Only Friday dipped to 5.7 and Sunday to 6.4. The Tuesday bedtime discipline is becoming a habit, and I'm seeing the cascading benefits in workout quality and recovery.

Physically, I'm noticing continued body composition changes. My jeans are looser in the waist, and I can see more definition in my quads and shoulders. Resting heart rate is now 57 bpm (down from 58 last week). I had minor quad soreness Friday morning from Thursday's intervals, but foam rolling and stretching resolved it. No injuries. Hydration stayed consistent at 2.6-2.9L daily.

Post-dinner walks happened 6 times this week (every day except Saturday when I did the long run)—15-30 minutes each. This has become a non-negotiable part of my routine, and I love the mental clarity it provides.

Psychologically, I'm feeling strong and confident. The 25-workout streak is a huge milestone. I'm seeing real performance gains—my tempo pace feels more sustainable, my long runs feel less daunting, and my recovery is faster. The protein timing experiment on Saturday showed promise, so I want to continue refining that.

Challenges: Friday's sleep slip was frustrating, and I need to be more disciplined about not sacrificing sleep for research or planning. The late-night snacking on Friday was stress-driven, and I need better coping strategies when work pressure hits. Social eating (Thursday dinner, Sunday family meal) added extra calories, but I'm learning to balance enjoyment with awareness.

W09 focus goals: maintain 6.7+ hours sleep average (especially protect Friday night), sustain 77%+ diet adherence, hit 30 consecutive workout sessions (need 5 more), implement consistent pre-long-run protein timing, develop a stress management strategy that doesn't involve food."
P06,2026-W09,22.4,22.1,55.3,2168,6.8,"Week 9 was incredibly solid—I hit 30 consecutive scheduled workouts, which feels like a huge psychological milestone! My sleep average landed at 6.8 hours (best ever, beating last week's 6.7), and I'm genuinely proud of how I protected Friday night this time. Diet adherence came in at 79%, my highest yet, despite a challenging midweek work event. The pre-long-run protein timing is now a non-negotiable part of my Saturday routine—Greek yogurt with banana 90 minutes before running has become my secret weapon. I felt incredibly strong during my W21 long run, maintaining negative splits for the second week in a row and actually enjoying the final 20 minutes instead of just surviving them. My resting heart rate dropped to 56 bpm, and I'm noticing real body composition changes—my jeans are looser around the waist, and my shoulders have visible definition now. The non-food stress management experiment (Tuesday evening stretching session instead of snacking) worked beautifully, and I repeated it Thursday with similar success. Budget stayed tight at 49.2 SAR/day average, well under my 50 SAR limit. Challenges were minimal this week: Sunday's family gathering tested my resolve (kunafa is my weakness), but I balanced it with portion control and a post-meal walk. Wednesday's W11 tempo felt harder than expected—my quads were still recovering from Monday's W03 session—but I completed all intervals within target pace. I'm sleeping better, eating cleaner, running stronger, and feeling more in control than I have in months. The consistency is finally translating into tangible results, both physical and mental."

I did skip the knafeh snack twice because it felt too heavy before my gym sessions, replacing it with dates and almonds instead. The Mandi lunch was amazing but I found the portion size quite large on a couple of days, so I reduced the rice slightly.

My legs workout on day 5 left me quite sore. Energy levels were good throughout the week, especially on days when I hit my calorie targets.

P06,2026-W41,10.1,27.15,51.5,2050,6.5,"This week was challenging but rewarding! I managed to stick to the meal plan about 75-80% of the time. The Ful Medames breakfast was filling and kept me energized through morning workouts. I loved the lamb kebabs but occasionally swapped them for chicken when lamb wasn't available. The advanced gym workouts were intense - I had to scale back slightly on the arms and shoulders days as they were quite demanding. My endurance has noticeably improved during cardio warm-ups. Sleep remained a struggle with my schedule, averaging around 6.5 hours. I felt hungry mid-afternoon a few times and added an extra piece of fruit. The dates and almonds snack was perfect post-workout. Overall energy levels were good, though I felt fatigued on day 6."
P06,2026-W42,9.7,27.25,51.2,1950,6.3,"This week was challenging but rewarding! I managed to stick to the meal plan about 75-80% of the time. The shakshuka breakfasts were delicious and easy to prepare. I found the Chicken Kabsa filling and perfect for my training days. However, I skipped the 4th meal (rice pudding) twice because I wasn't hungry enough after dinner, and once I had a work dinner that threw off my plan. The workouts were intense - the advanced gym sessions really pushed me, especially the leg day. I felt strong during back and chest days. My energy levels were good overall, though I noticed some fatigue mid-week, probably because my sleep averaged slightly less than usual due to early morning gym sessions. I'm seeing some definition improvements and my endurance during cardio warm-ups has noticeably increased. The 2100 kcal target felt appropriate - not too restrictive but clean enough to support my goals."

The foul medames breakfast was filling and gave me great energy for morning workouts. I struggled a bit with the advanced gym sessions - they're definitely pushing my limits, especially the leg day. I had to reduce weights on a few exercises but completed all sets. The endurance focus is showing - I feel less fatigued during longer sessions. Sleep was still an issue; I averaged around 6.5 hours due to work commitments, but I'm trying to improve that. The dates as a pre-workout snack worked surprisingly well for quick energy. I did skip the 4th meal twice this week when I had late dinners. Overall, I'm pleased with my adherence and can feel improvements in my stamina."
P06,2026-W44,9.3,27.5,51.6,1950,6.5,"This week went pretty well overall! I managed to stick to the meal plan about 75-80% of the time. The shakshuka breakfast was delicious and easy to prep, though I skipped it twice when I overslept. The grilled fish meals were great for post-workout recovery. I found the chicken kabsa a bit heavy some evenings, so I reduced portions slightly on two days. The mixed nuts and fruit snack was perfect between meals. Training-wise, I completed all 5 gym sessions as planned. The advanced workouts were challenging but manageable at my intermediate level - I had to reduce weight on some exercises but kept the volume high. My endurance definitely improved during the back and leg days. Sleep was still an issue - averaged around 6.5 hours, same as usual. I felt energized most days but noticed fatigue catching up by Friday. I'm seeing small improvements in my stamina during cardio warm-ups."

The Ful Medames breakfast was filling and kept me energized through morning workouts. I really enjoyed the chicken shawarma wraps - they were easy to prep ahead. The advanced gym workouts were intense, especially the leg day, but I pushed through. I did skip one arm workout day due to fatigue and had to reduce weights slightly on shoulder day. My endurance during cardio warm-ups improved noticeably by day 5. Sleep was still a struggle - averaged around 6.5 hours due to work commitments. I felt a bit more defined and my recovery between sets improved. The date smoothie became my favorite post-workout treat. Overall, I'm pleased with my adherence and can feel my stamina building."
P06,2026-W46,8.7,27.9,51.6,2035,6.5,"This week was pretty solid overall! I managed to stick to the meal plan about 75-80% of the time. The shakshuka breakfast was delicious and kept me full, though I sometimes rushed it on busy mornings. The kabsa became my favorite meal - really satisfying after workouts. I did skip the fattoush salad twice and grabbed something quicker instead. The date smoothie was perfect post-workout. Training 5 days felt intense with advanced programs, especially the leg day. I noticed better endurance during my runs between lifting sessions. Energy levels were good most days, though I'm still not getting quite enough sleep. My muscles feel worked but recovering well. I can feel myself getting stronger, particularly in my back and shoulder exercises. The budget worked fine - cooking at home helped a lot. I'd say I'm adapting well to this volume of training."

The Ful Medames breakfast was filling and kept me energized through morning workouts. I loved the salmon and quinoa combo - definitely a keeper. The shawarma wraps were convenient for my busy schedule. I did skip the date bars twice when I was running late. The workouts were challenging but doable at my intermediate level, though the advanced programming pushed me hard. I felt the chest and leg days especially. My energy levels were good during endurance-focused cardio sessions I added between strength days. Sleep was still around 6-7 hours most nights due to work schedule, but I tried to be consistent. I noticed slightly better recovery and felt leaner by the end of the week. The 2100 calorie target felt appropriate - never too hungry or overly full."
P06,2026-W48,8.2,28.3,52.1,2180,6.5,"This week was pretty solid overall! I managed to stick to the meal plan about 75-80% of the time. The shakshuka breakfast was delicious and kept me energized for morning workouts. The kabsa portions were generous and perfect for post-workout recovery. I did struggle a bit with the advanced gym workouts - they're definitely challenging and I had to scale back slightly on some of the heavier compound movements, especially on back and legs day. My endurance is improving though, and I'm noticing I can push through cardio finishers more easily. Sleep was still an issue - averaging around 6.5 hours because of work commitments, which I know isn't ideal. I felt a bit more fatigued toward the end of the week. The hummus snack was a lifesaver between meals, and the dates with laban became my favorite pre-workout fuel. I did have one cheat meal on Friday night with friends, so my daily average calories were slightly higher than planned. Overall, feeling stronger and my recovery between sessions has been good."
P07,2025-W46,15.1,30,77.9,2635,7.4,"Solid week overall! The 3100 kcal diet felt substantial but manageable with my cooking skills. Shakshouka became my favorite breakfast - love the protein punch from those eggs. The kabsa was incredible, reminded me why I got into advanced cooking in the first place. Jareesh took some getting used to texture-wise but the beef made it worthwhile. Hit all 5 workouts as planned - chest day was brutal but in a good way, and legs day on Friday left me properly exhausted. Missed one serving of the labneh snack on Wednesday because I got caught up at work, and Thursday's dinner came about 90 minutes late. Sleep averaged around 7.5 hours most nights, though I only got 6.5 on Tuesday after a late gaming session. Feeling stronger on all my compound lifts, especially noticing progress on bench and deadlift. The high protein is definitely supporting recovery. Energy levels stayed high throughout the week. Ready to keep pushing!"
P07,2025-W47,15,30.3,78.5,2780,7.4,"Completed the full week simulation for W47 (Nov 17-23, 2025). As an advanced lifter with high adherence propensity (85%), I stayed remarkably consistent throughout the week. The 2822 kcal target with Saudi-focused meals fit perfectly within my 60 SAR/day budget - I was spending around 45-55 SAR most days on quality proteins, rice, dates, and vegetables from local markets.

Day 1 (Monday): Started strong with W03 (Chest day). Hit all meals on time, felt energized from the carb load (353g daily target). The kabsa rice and grilled chicken combo post-workout was perfect for recovery. Sleep was solid at 7.5 hours.

Day 2 (Tuesday): W07 workout (Shoulders) went excellent. Noticed the consistent protein intake (177g) really supporting recovery. Had all 5-6 meals as planned. Energy levels high throughout the day.

Day 3 (Wednesday): W11 (Arms) - this is where I noticed the improved pump mentioned in my notes. The steady carb intake over the first few days really filled out my muscles. Skipped my mid-afternoon snack due to a work meeting running late - this accounts for my ~85% adherence. Still hit about 2650 kcal for the day.

Day 4 (Thursday): W15 (Back day). Strength felt great on deadlifts and rows. The 30g fiber daily from whole grains and vegetables kept digestion smooth - no issues with the Saudi cuisine as my body has adapted well. Sleep dipped slightly to 7.2 hours due to late-night work call.

Day 5 (Friday): W21 (Legs) - always the toughest session. Pushed through squats and leg press. Dinner was delayed by about 90 minutes because of family gathering, but I made sure to have a protein shake to bridge the gap. This was my second minor adherence slip.

Day 6 (Saturday): Rest day. Focused on meal prep for the week ahead. Body feeling good, noticed slight fullness in muscles - the glycogen supercompensation from consistent carbs is visible. Sleep caught up at 7.6 hours.

Day 7 (Sunday): Active recovery with light stretching. Weighed in and measured - definitely seeing the benefit of the structured plan. The advanced cooking skills made meal prep efficient and enjoyable.

Overall: 5/5 workouts completed as scheduled, approximately 85% meal adherence (missed 1 snack, 1 delayed dinner), averaged 7.4 hours sleep. The muscle gain protocol is working well - feeling fuller, stronger, and recovery has been on point. The budget was never an issue, which allowed me to focus purely on hitting macros and training hard."
P07,2025-W48,14.9,30.5,79.1,2847,7.4,"Week 48 wrapped up strong. Coming off the momentum from W47, I maintained my discipline pretty well this week. Started Monday (Day 1) feeling fresh after the weekend - nailed the chest workout (W03) and hit all my meal targets. The 353g carbs felt perfect for fueling these intense sessions. Tuesday's shoulder workout (W07) was brutal but productive; felt some fatigue creeping in by evening but nothing sleep couldn't fix. Wednesday I had a minor slip - was rushing between errands and grabbed a shawarma that put me about 150 kcal over target, but macros weren't too far off. Thursday's arm day (W11) was solid, pumps were incredible. Friday back workout (W15) - this is where I really shine, pulled some heavy deadlifts and felt the muscle engagement throughout. Saturday's leg day (W21) left me properly exhausted but satisfied. Sunday was active recovery with meal prep for the coming week. 

The 60 SAR daily budget continues to work perfectly - I'm getting quality protein from local butchers (chicken breast at 18-20 SAR/kg, lean beef at 35 SAR/kg), buying rice and oats in bulk, and still have room for vegetables and occasional treats. My advanced cooking skills mean I'm not wasting money on eating out except that one Wednesday slip. Sleep averaged around 7.4 hours as usual - I'm naturally consistent here. Some nights were closer to 7 hours when I stayed up doing meal prep or watching training videos, but never dipped below 6.5.

Physically, I'm noticing continued fullness in my muscles, especially in the mornings. The scale is trending up slowly which is exactly what I want in this gaining phase. Strength is progressing incrementally - added 2.5kg to my bench press working sets this week, and my squat depth feels more comfortable at heavier loads. No digestive issues with the Saudi cuisine integration - my body has fully adapted to the rice, dates, grilled meats rotation. 

One challenge this week was managing energy levels mid-week. Wednesday and Thursday I felt slightly more fatigued than usual, possibly from accumulated training volume. I adjusted by adding an extra 50g carbs post-workout on Thursday which helped. My 85% adherence propensity showed up accurately - that one meal deviation on Wednesday was the 15% showing through, but I course-corrected immediately. No missed workouts, all five sessions completed with full intensity. 

Looking ahead, I'm feeling confident about maintaining this trajectory. The consistency is paying off, and I'm not experiencing any burnout or motivation dips. Body composition is definitely trending in the right direction - visual changes in shoulder caps and back thickness. Ready to push into Week 49 with the same energy."
P07,2025-W49,14.8,30.6,79.4,2848,7.4,"Week 49 felt like a continuation of the solid momentum from W48. Started Monday with strong energy levels and hit W03 chest workout with excellent pump - managed to add another 2.5kg to my incline press which felt controlled through the full ROM. Tuesday's rest day nutrition was dialed in, prepped meals kept me right on target macros. Wednesday's W07 shoulder session was intense; felt some fatigue creeping in mid-workout but pushed through the lateral raise dropsets. The 60 SAR budget continues to work perfectly - stocked up on chicken breast at a good price and grabbed extra dates and honey for intra-workout carbs.

Thursday I noticed I was slightly hungrier than usual, probably from the volume accumulation, so I added an extra 100 kcal through a banana and almond butter post-training. Friday's W11 arms workout delivered insane bicep and tricep pumps - the superset protocol is really working. Saturday's W15 back session was probably my best of the week; deadlifts felt explosive and I maintained perfect form even on the final working set. Added 5kg to my bent-over row which is a nice strength marker.

Sunday's W21 leg day was brutal but productive. Squats went deep and controlled, hit 3x8 at working weight with no knee issues. Hamstring curls and leg press volume left me limping slightly but in that good DOMS way. Sleep averaged around 7.4 hours which is my sweet spot - only one night dipped to 7 hours due to early morning work commitment but recovered well. No digestive issues, energy stayed high throughout, and I'm visually noticing more fullness in my delts and upper chest. The Saudi meal timing around training continues to optimize performance. Adherence was about 83-84% this week with minor deviations on two days where I was slightly under on fats but compensated with extra protein. Overall, another strong week in the gaining phase."
P07,2025-W50,14.7,30.75,79.8,3018,7.4,"Week 50 was a solid continuation of my gaining phase. Coming off W49's strong performance, I maintained the momentum with all 5 programmed workouts completed and nutrition dialed in at 86% adherence—just 1% above my baseline propensity. The advanced cooking skills really helped me prep efficiently, keeping meals interesting while hitting macros.

Monday's chest workout (W03) felt powerful—incline press moved smoothly with the +2.5kg I added last week, and I pushed for an extra rep on the final set. Tuesday's shoulder session (W07) was intense; lateral raises are really targeting that medial delt development I'm after. Wednesday I strategically added +120 kcal to manage mid-week hunger (similar pattern to last week's Thursday spike), which kept energy levels high for Thursday's arm workout (W11).

Friday's back day (W15) was exceptional—the +5kg on bent-over rows from last week is sticking, and I'm feeling significant lat engagement. The pump was insane. Saturday's leg workout (W21) left me with predictable DOMS, but I'm noticing better depth consistency on squats and my quads are responding well to the volume.

Sleep averaged 7.4 hours again (range: 7.1-7.6 hrs), which seems to be my sweet spot. Budget management was even better this week—58.7 SAR/day average, leaving a 1.3 SAR daily cushion. Only minor deviation was Sunday when I undershot fat by 12g due to leaner protein choices at dinner, but overall macros stayed tight.

Physique-wise, I'm seeing continued improvements in upper body fullness—shoulders and chest are looking more developed, and the mirror is showing better separation in my back. Weight gain is steady at +0.4kg this week, which aligns perfectly with my controlled surplus goal. No injuries, form remains solid, and I'm feeling strong and recovered between sessions. Ready to push harder in W51."
P07,2025-W51,14.6,30.95,80.3,2858,7.4,"Week 51 wrapped up strong. Came into this week riding momentum from W50's solid adherence and progressive overload gains. The 5-workout schedule hit perfectly—Chest (W03), Shoulders (W07), Arms (W11), Back (W15), and Legs (W21) all completed without any skipped sessions. My adherence propensity of 85% actually played out closer to 88% this week, which I attribute to better meal prep timing and keeping my environment dialed in.

Monday started with chest work—incline press felt explosive, maintained that +2.5kg progression from last week and added an extra rep on the third set. Pec activation was immediate, and I could feel the mind-muscle connection locking in. Nutrition-wise, I front-loaded carbs around the workout window (about 90g pre-workout, 70g post) which kept energy levels stable throughout the session. Hit 2,890 kcal that day, slightly over target but intentional given the volume.

Tuesday was shoulder day. Overhead pressing felt strong—no shoulder impingement issues, which has been a focus point for me. Lateral raises with controlled tempo really torched the medial delts. I could see the pump lasting well into the evening. Managed 2,825 kcal with a solid protein distribution across 5 meals. Sleep was 7.3 hours, which is right in my wheelhouse.

Wednesday brought arms, and honestly, this was one of those sessions where everything clicked. Bicep curls with strict form, tricep extensions with full ROM—the pump was ridiculous. I strategically added about 110 kcal mid-afternoon because I felt a hunger wave coming on, learned from last week's Wednesday adjustment. Ended at 2,965 kcal. No regrets—kept me from any evening binge risk.

Thursday's back session was a highlight. Bent-over rows at +5kg felt controlled and powerful. I'm really focusing on scapular retraction and lat engagement rather than just moving weight. Deadlifts were programmed lighter for volume, and my lower back felt solid throughout. Nutrition stayed tight at 2,840 kcal. Sleep dipped slightly to 7.2 hours due to some work stress, but nothing that impacted recovery noticeably.

Friday was leg day, and as expected, it was brutal in the best way. Squats went deep—I'm really focusing on depth consistency, and it's paying off with better quad activation. Leg press and hamstring curls rounded out the volume. Left the gym with that familiar leg-day wobble. Hit 2,880 kcal with extra carbs post-workout to support glycogen replenishment. DOMS kicked in hard Friday night.

Weekend was active recovery. Saturday I kept movement light—20 minutes of walking, some stretching, foam rolling the quads and glutes. Nutrition was 2,795 kcal, slightly under target but appetite was naturally lower. Sleep bounced back to 7.5 hours. Sunday I did another light walk and meal prepped for the upcoming week. Came in at 2,810 kcal. Sleep was excellent at 7.6 hours.

Physically, I'm seeing continued improvements. Shoulder caps are more pronounced, chest striations are becoming visible under good lighting, and back width is noticeably increasing when I check progress photos. Muscle fullness is high—likely a combination of glycogen supercompensation and consistent training stimulus. Weight crept up by about 0.5kg over the week, which tracks with my gaining phase goals. Some of that is definitely water retention and glycogen, but I'm confident there's lean tissue accretion happening given strength progression and visual changes.

Budget management was on point. Averaged 58.7 SAR per day, leaving me with about 1.3 SAR surplus daily. Advanced cooking skills made it easy to batch-cook high-protein meals efficiently—grilled chicken thighs, lean beef, eggs, and rice/sweet potatoes formed the base. Added variety with Greek yogurt, nuts, and strategic fruit timing around workouts.

No injuries, no form breakdowns, no missed workouts. Recovery felt excellent throughout. DOMS was present after legs but well within normal parameters—managed with adequate protein (averaged 181g/day), hydration, and sleep. Energy levels were consistently high, likely supported by the 7.4-hour average sleep and well-timed carb intake.

Looking ahead, I'm planning to maintain this trajectory. Strength is progressing steadily, physique is responding well, and adherence is sustainable. Might experiment with a slight carb increase on leg days next week to see if it enhances performance further, but overall, the current macro split is working beautifully. Feeling strong, looking fuller, and mentally locked in. This is what consistent effort looks like."
P07,2025-W52,14.5,31.15,80.7,2881,7.4,"Week 52 was another solid execution block. Locked in mentally from day one, and the consistency from W51 carried over seamlessly. All 5 workouts completed as scheduled—W03 Chest on Monday felt powerful, hit the incline press for 4x8 at +2.5kg from baseline with controlled tempo. W07 Shoulders on Tuesday showcased improved deltoid activation, especially on lateral raises where I felt the burn deep in the medial head. W11 Arms on Thursday was a pump fest; biceps and triceps responded well to the volume. W15 Back on Friday had me pulling heavy on bent-over rows, scapular retraction on point, and I added another 2.5kg to the working sets. W21 Legs on Saturday was brutal but productive—squat depth consistency maintained, quads were screaming by the end, and I hit a new depth PR on the third set. DOMS peaked Sunday/Monday but manageable with foam rolling and stretching.

Nutrition adherence was stellar at 87%, just slightly above my 85% propensity. Daily kcal averaged 2,881 (target 2,872), so virtually spot-on. Protein intake was 180g/day (target 179g), carbs 361g/day (target 359g), and fats 78g/day (target 79g). The macro precision is dialed in now—advanced cooking skills made meal prep efficient, and I even experimented with a new post-workout rice bowl recipe that hit the carb timing perfectly on leg day. Budget utilization was 59.2 SAR/day average, leaving a small 0.8 SAR daily cushion, which is ideal for sustainability.

Sleep averaged 7.4 hours (range: 7.1-7.6 hours), consistent with my baseline. Recovery felt solid; no lingering fatigue or joint issues. Muscle fullness indicators are trending up—deltoids are more capped, chest striations are holding even with the slight caloric surplus, and back width is visibly increasing. Quads are responding well to the depth-focused squats, and I'm noticing more separation in the vastus medialis. Weight increased by approximately +0.4kg over the week, which aligns with expectations for lean tissue accretion, glycogen supercompensation, and minimal fat gain given the controlled surplus.

No injuries, form integrity maintained across all compound lifts. I focused on scapular control during rows and maintained neutral spine on squats, which prevented any lower back discomfort. The strategic carb timing adjustment on leg day (Saturday) worked well—I front-loaded 80g of carbs pre-workout and another 90g post-workout, which fueled performance and recovery without causing digestive issues.

Mental state remains locked in. Motivation is high, and I'm seeing tangible visual improvements week over week. The mirror is reflecting the work: shoulder definition is sharper, chest detail is emerging, and back development is creating that V-taper. I'm confident in the trajectory and ready to keep pushing.

One minor hiccup: Wednesday evening I felt a bit sluggish, possibly due to accumulated fatigue from the first three workouts, but I managed it with an extra 15-minute nap and a slight bump in carbs at dinner (added 30g via sweet potato). This prevented any deviation from the plan.

Looking ahead, I'm considering a slight increase in training volume on back day (adding a fifth set to rows) and potentially experimenting with a carb cycling approach where I bump carbs to 400g on leg day and reduce to 330g on rest days. But for now, the current protocol is working, so no urgent changes needed.

Overall, Week 52 was a strong finish to the year. Adherence, recovery, and progression are all on track. Let's keep this momentum rolling into 2026."
P07,2026-W01,14.4,31.42,81.2,2918,7.4,"Week 1 of 2026 went exceptionally well. I managed to hit all 5 planned workouts with solid intensity and progressive overload across all sessions. The W03 Chest day on Monday felt explosive—I added another 2.5kg to my incline press and maintained strict form throughout. W07 Shoulders on Tuesday had me feeling that satisfying burn in my delts, especially on the lateral raises where I focused on controlled eccentrics. Wednesday's W11 Arms session was brutal in the best way; bicep peaks are definitely more pronounced now. Thursday's W15 Back workout was a highlight—I increased weight on bent-over rows again and felt exceptional scapular engagement. The pump was insane. Friday's W21 Legs day left me properly destroyed; I pushed depth on squats and felt every fiber in my quads working. DOMS peaked Sunday/Monday as expected, but I managed it well with foam rolling and extra stretching.

Nutrition was dialed in at 2,918 kcal daily average, just 7 kcal over target—basically perfect. Protein stayed consistent at 183g/day (1g over target), carbs at 366g/day (2g over), and fats at 80g/day (1g under). My advanced cooking skills made meal prep efficient; I batch-cooked chicken, rice, and veggies on Sunday which saved time all week. The post-workout rice bowl recipe I developed last week continued to be a winner—jasmine rice, grilled chicken, avocado, and a homemade tahini-lime dressing. Budget utilization was excellent at 58.8 SAR/day average (98% efficiency), leaving me a small daily surplus of 1.2 SAR which I'll roll into next week.

Sleep averaged 7.4 hours (range: 7.2-7.6 hrs), right on target. I had one night (Wednesday) where I felt slightly sluggish during the day, but a 20-minute power nap and an extra 30g carbs at dinner fixed that immediately. Recovery protocols were on point: foam rolling every evening, dynamic stretching pre-workout, static stretching post-workout, and consistent hydration (3.5-4L daily).

Physically, I'm seeing continued improvements. Muscle fullness is excellent—deltoids look more capped, chest striations are holding even with the slight caloric surplus, back width is visibly increasing, and my quads are showing better vastus medialis separation. I estimate I gained about 0.5kg this week, mostly lean tissue and glycogen with minimal fat accumulation. My waist measurement stayed the same, which confirms the quality of the weight gain. The mirror test shows sharper shoulder definition, emerging chest detail, and continued V-taper development in my back.

Mentally, I'm locked in and highly motivated. The consistency from last week carried over seamlessly. My adherence propensity of 85% proved accurate—I hit 100% workout completion and 96% nutrition adherence (had one meal on Saturday that was slightly off-macro but still within reasonable range). The carb timing adjustment I implemented on leg day (80g pre-workout, 90g post-workout) continues to be effective; I felt strong throughout the entire session and recovery was smooth.

Looking ahead, I'm considering a slight volume increase on back day—maybe adding one more set to pull-ups or an additional rowing variation. I'm also toying with the idea of a carb cycling experiment, but honestly, the current protocol is working so well that I'm hesitant to change anything. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. The progressive overload is happening naturally, recovery is solid, and body composition is trending in the right direction. No injuries, no setbacks, just consistent gains. Let's keep this momentum rolling into Week 2."
P07,2026-W02,14.3,31.56,81.6,3041,7.4,"Week 2 of 2026 was absolutely stellar. Coming off last week's momentum, I maintained exceptional adherence across all five training sessions and nailed my nutrition targets with surgical precision. Monday's chest session (W03) felt explosive—managed to push the incline press even harder, feeling that upper pec engagement dialing in. Tuesday shoulders (W07) brought that capped delt look I've been chasing; lateral raises were crisp, and I could see the striations in the mirror post-pump. Wednesday arms (W11) had me feeling a bit flat early on, likely due to accumulated fatigue, but a strategic 20-minute power nap at 14:30 and an extra 40g carbs from dates and honey turned things around completely. Bicep peaks were popping by the end of the session.

Thursday's back workout (W15) was a highlight—added another 2.5kg to bent-over rows and felt my lats stretching the fabric of my shirt. The V-taper is becoming more pronounced, and I'm considering bumping back volume slightly in the coming weeks to capitalize on this responsiveness. Friday legs (W21) absolutely destroyed me in the best way possible. Hit a new squat depth PR, and the quad separation is becoming more visible even in relaxed state. DOMS peaked Sunday morning but foam rolling, contrast showers, and active recovery walks kept me functional.

Nutrition was dialed: averaged 3,041 kcal daily (target 3,037), protein at 190g (target 189g), carbs 381g (target 379g), fats 83g (target 84g). Budget came in at 59.2 SAR/day, leaving a tiny cushion for next week. Sleep remained consistent at 7.4 hours, though Saturday night dipped to 6.9 hours due to social plans—made up for it Sunday with 8.1 hours. Recovery protocols on point: magnesium glycinate before bed, BCAAs intra-workout, creatine monohydrate daily.

Visual changes: muscle fullness is exceptional, particularly in shoulders and quads. Chest striations are holding even in morning fasted state. Weight trending up appropriately without excessive water retention. Mental state is locked in—motivation high, consistency unwavering. Zero injuries, form integrity maintained across all lifts. The only minor hiccup was Wednesday's sluggishness, but the quick adjustment proved my ability to adapt on the fly. Considering implementing a strategic carb cycling approach for next mesocycle, but current protocol is clearly working. Overall, this week reinforced that my systems—training, nutrition, recovery—are synergizing perfectly. Ready to push even harder."
P07,2026-W03,14.2,31.68,81.9,3041,7.4,"Week 3 of 2026 was another solid block. Hit all 5 workouts (W03, W07, W11, W15, W21) with progressive overload continuing on several key movements. Incline press went up another 2.5kg to 87.5kg for working sets—felt strong and controlled. Bent-over rows also climbed 2.5kg, now at 95kg, and the squeeze at the top is really activating my mid-back. Squat depth PR from last week held strong; I'm sitting deeper in the hole with better ankle mobility. Wednesday brought minor fatigue again, but I've dialed in the carb timing pre-workout and grabbed a 25-minute power nap which made a huge difference. Legs on Friday left me with predictable DOMS, managed with foam rolling, contrast showers, and a light active recovery walk on Saturday. Sleep averaged 7.4 hours (range 6.9 to 8.1), right on target. Nutrition was dialed: 3,041 kcal/day average, protein 190g, carbs 381g, fats 83g—basically nailed the macros. Budget efficiency stayed at 98.7%, spending 59.2 SAR/day on average. Visual changes continue: shoulder caps are popping, chest striations under good lighting, V-taper is pronounced, and quad separation is getting sharper. Recovery stack is consistent—magnesium glycinate before bed, BCAAs intra-workout, creatine post-workout. Mental state is locked in, motivation high, no injuries, form integrity pristine. Considering a slight back volume increase next mesocycle and experimenting with carb cycling around rest days, but honestly the current protocol is optimal and I'm seeing steady progress. Weight ticked up slightly as expected with muscle gain phase—up 0.3kg from start of week, muscle mass up marginally, fat percent holding steady or dropping a hair. Feeling strong, looking better, recovery is on point. Let's keep this momentum."
P07,2026-W04,14.1,31.85,82.3,3102,7.5,"Week 4 of 2026 was highly productive. Managed all 5 scheduled workouts (W03, W07, W11, W15, W21) with strong adherence matching my 85% propensity—honestly closer to 95% this week since I'm in a good rhythm. Progressive overload continued: hit 90kg on incline press (up from 87.5kg), pushed bent-over rows to 97.5kg, and maintained perfect squat depth even when fatigue set in Thursday. The advanced fitness level really shows—recovery between sets is efficient, form stays tight even on final reps.

Nutrition was dialed in at 3,088 kcal daily target. Actually averaged 3,102 kcal across the week (slight surplus of 14 kcal/day) with macros landing at 194g protein, 387g carbs, 85g fat. Budget held strong at 59.4 SAR/day (99% efficiency). My advanced cooking skills made meal prep seamless: Sunday batch-cooked chicken thighs, jasmine rice, and roasted vegetables. Wednesday's fatigue was real after the leg session—managed it with a 45-min power nap and strategic carb timing (120g carbs pre-workout, 80g post). DOMS in quads and glutes Thursday-Friday responded well to my recovery protocol: foam rolling twice daily, contrast showers, 30-min active recovery walk Saturday.

Sleep averaged 7.5 hours this week (range 7.1-8.0), slightly above my baseline 7.4 hrs. The extra rest came from prioritizing 10pm bedtime on recovery days. Supplementation consistent: 400mg magnesium glycinate before bed, 10g BCAAs intra-workout, 5g creatine monohydrate daily. Visual changes are encouraging—shoulder caps popping more, chest striations visible in good lighting, V-taper pronounced, quad separation improving. The 14.2% body fat is holding steady while muscle fullness increases, exactly what I want on this lean bulk.

No injuries, no form breakdown. Considered increasing back volume (adding a 4th set to rows) but decided to hold current protocol another week—it's working optimally. Carb cycling idea still on my mind for future cut phase, but not needed now. Energy levels 8-9/10 most days, only dipped to 6/10 Wednesday post-legs. Gym performance strong across all sessions. Weight trending up gradually as expected with muscle gain goal. Overall, this week reinforced that my current training split, nutrition strategy, and recovery protocols are synergistic. Confidence high going into Week 5."
P07,2026-W05,13.9,32.15,82.8,3102,7.5,"Week 5 of 2026 was exceptionally productive. Started Monday with W03 (Push A) and immediately noticed the progressive overload paying dividends—incline press at 90kg felt challenging but manageable for 4x8, maintaining strict form throughout. Tuesday's W07 (Pull A) saw bent-over rows at 97.5kg, which really taxed my lats and mid-back. The DOMS from these sessions were intense but expected given the load increases.

Wednesday's W11 (Legs A) was brutal as always. Squats at working weight left me absolutely gassed, but I maintained depth on every rep. Post-workout fatigue hit hard around 3 PM, so I implemented my usual strategy: 45-minute power nap and precisely timed carbs (120g pre-workout oats and banana, 80g post-workout white rice with chicken). This recovery protocol worked perfectly—I was functional for the evening.

Thursday's W15 (Push B) and Saturday's W21 (Pull B) rounded out the week beautifully. Energy levels were consistently 8-9/10 except for that Wednesday dip to 6/10, which is standard for leg day recovery. Foam rolling twice daily and contrast showers (3 minutes hot, 1 minute cold, repeated 3x) kept the DOMS manageable. Added a 30-minute active recovery walk on Saturday morning before the Pull B session—really helped with blood flow and mental clarity.

Nutrition was dialed in perfectly. Average daily intake hit 3,102 kcal (slightly above the 2,935 target, but intentional for muscle gain), with macros at 194g protein, 387g carbs, 85g fat. My advanced cooking skills made meal prep efficient: batch-cooked 2kg chicken breast, 3kg sweet potatoes, and prepped overnight oats for the week on Sunday. Budget efficiency was 99% at 59.4 SAR/day out of my 60 SAR allowance.

Visual improvements continue to impress me—shoulder caps are more pronounced, chest striations visible under good lighting, V-taper is developing nicely, and quad separation is becoming more defined even at 14.1% body fat. My recovery stack (400mg magnesium glycinate before bed, 10g BCAAs intra-workout, 5g creatine post-workout) is clearly supporting adaptation.

Sleep averaged 7.5 hours (range 7.1-8.0), which is my sweet spot for recovery. No injuries, form remains excellent across all lifts. Confidence is sky-high. I'm holding this protocol as it's producing optimal results. Future considerations: potentially increasing back volume by adding one more rowing variation, and exploring carb cycling when I eventually transition to a cutting phase. For now, the muscle gain train continues full speed ahead."
P07,2026-W06,13.8,32.35,83.2,3098,7.4,"Week 6 was another solid block. Hit all 5 workouts as planned with excellent intensity. W03 chest session felt powerful—incline press moved smoothly at 90kg for 4x8, and I managed to add a 9th rep on the third set which felt like a breakthrough. W07 back day was brutal in the best way; bent-over rows at 97.5kg are becoming more comfortable, and I'm feeling the mind-muscle connection dialing in. Lats are responding well. Wednesday's W11 leg session (squat/RDL focus) left me predictably wrecked, but I anticipated it and had my pre-workout carbs dialed in at 125g and nailed a 40-min post-workout nap which salvaged the rest of the day. DOMS peaked Thursday morning but foam rolling twice daily plus a contrast shower Thursday evening brought it down to manageable levels. Friday's W15 shoulder/arms session was clean—lateral raises are up in weight slightly and the pump was insane. Sunday's W21 full-body conditioning kept me active without overdoing it. Sleep averaged 7.4 hours this week (range 7.0-7.9), slightly below my usual 7.5 but still solid. One night (Tuesday) I stayed up a bit late meal prepping for the week ahead, which cut into sleep but paid dividends in adherence. Nutrition was on point: averaged 3,098 kcal/day, 195g protein, 385g carbs, 86g fat. Stayed within budget at 59.1 SAR/day—found a deal on chicken breasts and bulk jasmine rice which helped. Recovery stack consistent: magnesium glycinate before bed, BCAAs intra-workout, creatine post-workout. Energy levels were 8-9/10 most days, dipped to 7/10 on Thursday due to leg DOMS but rebounded quickly. Visually, I'm noticing more shoulder cap roundness and my chest is starting to show striations even at this body fat level. Vascularity in forearms and biceps is more prominent. Weight is trending up slowly and steadily, which is exactly what I want—no excess fat gain, just quality muscle. No injuries, form remains strict. Considering adding an extra back exercise (maybe weighted pull-ups) in the coming weeks to push that V-taper further. Overall adherence was 100% again, and I'm feeling strong, recovered, and motivated. The consistency is paying off."
P07,2026-W07,13.7,32.52,83.7,3098,7.4,"Week 7 was a solid continuation of my muscle gain trajectory. All 5 workouts completed as scheduled with progressive overload hitting on multiple exercises. The incline press felt strong—I managed to push 90kg for 4x8 with an extra rep on set 3, which is exactly the kind of incremental progress I'm after. Bent-over rows held steady at 97.5kg 4x8, and I added 1kg to lateral raises, which is paying off visually with enhanced shoulder caps.

Wednesday's leg session left me with expected DOMS, but I've dialed in my recovery protocol: 40-minute nap post-workout, foam rolling twice daily, and a contrast shower Thursday morning. This combo seems to be the sweet spot for managing soreness without compromising Friday's upper body session. Sleep averaged 7.4 hours (range 7.0-7.9), which is consistent with my baseline. Tuesday ran a bit late due to meal prep, but I prioritized it since my bulk chicken/rice deal came through at 59.1 SAR/day—98.5% budget efficiency.

Nutrition was dialed in: averaged 3,098 kcal/day with 195g protein, 385g carbs, and 86g fat. I'm slightly above my 2,964 kcal target, but given my training intensity and the fact that I'm seeing visual gains (chest striations, forearm/bicep vascularity), I'm not concerned. My body composition is responding well. Recovery stack remains consistent: 400mg magnesium glycinate before bed, 10g BCAAs intra-workout, and 5g creatine daily.

Energy levels stayed in the 7-9/10 range throughout the week. No injuries, no missed sessions—100% adherence maintained. I'm seriously considering adding weighted pull-ups to my routine, possibly on back day, as my bodyweight pull-ups are becoming too easy. Overall, I'm feeling strong, recovering well, and the muscle gain goal is clearly progressing. The advanced cooking skills are paying off with efficient meal prep that keeps me on budget and on target."
P07,2026-W08,13.6,32.68,84.1,3098,7.4,"Week 8 was another solid training block with all 5 workouts completed as scheduled. I pushed progressive overload successfully on several key lifts—incline press hit 90kg for 4x8 with an extra rep on set 3, and I added 1kg to lateral raises which felt surprisingly smooth. Bent-over rows stayed at 97.5kg 4x8 but form was cleaner than last week. Energy levels remained consistently high (7-9/10 range) throughout the week, which I attribute to maintaining my sleep around 7.4 hours and keeping nutrition dialed in.

Nutrition-wise, I averaged 3,098 kcal daily, which is 134 kcal above my 3,064 target—not perfect but well within acceptable variance for a lean bulk. Protein came in at 195g (+10g over target), carbs at 385g (+15g), and fats at 86g (+4g). The slight overage is partly due to Wednesday's post-leg-day refeed where I added an extra serving of rice and a banana to support recovery. My budget efficiency was excellent at 59.1 SAR/day (98.5% of my 60 SAR limit), thanks to finding a bulk deal on chicken breasts and basmati rice at the local market.

Recovery protocols were on point: 400mg magnesium glycinate before bed, 10g BCAAs during workouts, and 5g creatine daily. Wednesday's leg session (W11) left me with significant DOMS in quads and glutes, so I implemented a 40-minute nap Thursday afternoon, foam rolled twice daily (morning and evening), and used contrast showers Thursday and Friday which really helped flush out the soreness. By Saturday I felt fully recovered for the next leg session.

Visually, I'm noticing enhanced shoulder caps—the lateral raises are definitely paying off. Chest striations are more visible, especially in good lighting after pump sessions. Forearm and bicep vascularity has increased noticeably, likely a combination of the slight caloric surplus, hydration, and reduced sodium bloat from clean eating. No injuries whatsoever, joints feel healthy, and I'm moving well through full ROM on all exercises.

I'm seriously considering adding weighted pull-ups to back day (W07 and W15) starting next week. Current bodyweight pull-ups feel too easy at 15+ reps, so adding a 10kg plate for 4 sets of 8-10 reps would align better with my hypertrophy goals. My body is clearly responding well to the current volume and caloric surplus—weight is trending up slowly without excessive fat gain, and strength is progressing steadily. Adherence was 100% again this week. Sleep ranged from 7.0 to 7.9 hours with one late night Tuesday due to meal prep session running long, but I compensated with an earlier bedtime Wednesday. Overall, extremely satisfied with this week's execution and results."
P07,2026-W09,13.5,32.83,84.5,3087,7.4,"Week 9 (2026-W09) complete with all 5 workouts executed flawlessly. Started Monday with W03 chest/triceps - incline press hit 90kg for 4x8 with a solid grind on the final set, maintaining the rep gain from last cycle. Wednesday's W07 leg session was brutal as expected; quad DOMS peaked Thursday morning but managed through foam rolling sessions morning and evening plus a 35-minute post-lunch nap. Friday's W11 back day saw bent-over rows at 97.5kg feeling smoother, contemplating the 100kg jump next cycle. Lateral raises on W15 shoulder day Saturday went up another kilogram to 16kg dumbbells - shoulder caps are genuinely popping now with visible striations when flexed. Closed the week with W21 arms Sunday, bicep peaks looking fuller and forearm vascularity is insane during curls.

Nutrition stayed dialed: averaged 3,087 kcal daily, just 38 above target. Protein came in at 193g average (right on track), carbs at 388g (slight overage but needed for the training intensity), and fats at 84g. The bulk chicken and rice deal I secured last week continued to pay dividends - came in at 58.7 SAR/day average, leaving a small buffer for an extra whey shake on leg day. Meal prep Sunday took 2.5 hours but set me up perfectly for the week.

Sleep averaged 7.4 hours (range 7.1-7.8), consistent with my baseline. Tuesday night was slightly shorter at 7.1 due to a late meal prep adjustment, but recovered well. Recovery stack maintained: 400mg magnesium glycinate every night, 10g BCAAs intra-workout on all training days, 5g creatine daily without fail. Energy levels ranged 7-9/10 throughout the week, hitting 9/10 on back and shoulder days when motivation peaked.

Physical changes continue to manifest: chest striations are now visible even in relaxed state under good lighting, shoulder definition is next-level, and the bicep vein that runs down to my forearm is permanently visible. Weight trending up gradually as expected on this lean bulk. Zero injuries, zero missed workouts, adherence at 100% again. Body is responding incredibly well to the progressive overload and caloric surplus.

Decided to add weighted pull-ups (10kg plate) to next week's back day as planned - feeling strong enough to handle the additional stimulus. Considering a slight bump in shoulder volume given how responsive they've been. Overall, this is exactly how a training week should feel: challenging but manageable, progressive but sustainable, and visually rewarding."
P07,2026-W10,13.4,33.05,85.2,2950,7.5,"Solid first week on the plan. I managed to stick to the meal prep about 85% of the time - the Arabic omelette breakfast became my go-to and I actually looked forward to it. The lamb kebab dinners were incredible, and my advanced cooking skills made prep efficient. Hit the gym all 5 days as scheduled, felt strong on the compound lifts especially during back and leg days. The 3033 kcal target felt appropriate for my training volume, though I probably fell slightly short on a couple of busier days, averaging around 2950 kcal. Recovery felt good with 7.5 hours of sleep most nights. Noticed slight strength gains on bench press and deadlift. The date and nut energy balls were perfect post-workout fuel. Body feels fuller, slight weight increase as expected on a bulk. No major barriers this week - having a good budget and cooking skills made adherence easy."
P07,2026-W11,13.5,33.25,85.8,2720,7.4,"Solid first week on the plan. Hit about 85% adherence as expected - managed all 5 gym sessions and they were intense. The advanced splits really targeted each muscle group well. Nutrition was mostly on point, though I had a couple of days where I undershot calories by 200-300 due to work schedule. The shakshuka breakfast has become a favorite and the chicken kabsa is excellent fuel for training. Sleep stayed consistent around 7.5 hours. Feeling stronger on compound lifts, especially noticed improvement in back day. Recovery has been good with the protein intake. The date smoothie post-workout is perfect timing. Minor soreness in shoulders mid-week but nothing that impacted performance. Weight is up slightly as expected with the surplus, and I can see some fullness in muscles. Energy levels have been high throughout the week."

I managed to stick to the meal prep about 85% of the time - my advanced cooking skills definitely helped me batch-cook the grilled chicken and prep the ful medames in advance. The calorie target felt appropriate for my muscle gain goal, and I never felt overly stuffed or hungry. Training sessions were intense and productive - hit all 5 workout days as planned. The chest and back days were particularly challenging but in a good way. Recovery felt good with the protein intake being high. I did slip up twice on the weekend where I ate out with friends and probably went over my calorie target by 300-400 kcal each day, but overall adherence was strong. Sleep stayed consistent around 7.5 hours. Noticed some good pumps in the gym and feeling slightly fuller, especially in my upper body. Weight is up slightly which is expected on a surplus.

Hit the gym all 5 days as planned and felt strong throughout the workouts. The advanced splits were challenging but manageable given my fitness level. I noticed good pumps especially on chest and back days. The lamb chops dinner was excellent - my cooking skills definitely helped make these meals enjoyable. Only struggle was the mushabbak snack - sometimes swapped it for protein bars when I was short on time. Energy levels were high throughout the week, and I felt the calorie surplus was appropriate. Recovery between sessions felt solid with 7-8 hours of sleep most nights. Weight is up slightly as expected on a muscle gain phase, and I can see a bit more fullness in my upper body.

Shakshuka breakfast became a favorite. Only struggled a bit with the Luqaimat portion control on two evenings - ended up having a couple extra pieces. Energy levels were high throughout the week, and recovery between sessions was good. The 2940 kcal target kept me in a slight surplus which is exactly what I need. Noticed some fullness in my shoulders and chest by the end of the week, likely just pump and glycogen but felt good. Sleep stayed consistent around 7.5 hours most nights."

I did swap the mahalabia for Greek yogurt with honey and nuts twice because I wanted something less sweet post-workout. Energy levels were consistently high throughout the week, and recovery between sessions felt good with the 7.5 hours of sleep. Noticed slight fullness in my chest and shoulders by week's end, and the scale moved up a bit as expected on a surplus. Looking forward to continuing this momentum."

Only skipped the dates/walnuts snack twice when I was rushing between work and the gym. All five workouts completed as scheduled. The advanced splits felt challenging but manageable given my fitness level. Chest day on day 1 was intense, and legs on day 5 left me properly fatigued. Recovery has been solid with consistent 7-8 hours of sleep most nights. The calorie surplus is noticeable - feeling fuller and more energized during lifts. Strength is up slightly on compound movements already. The high protein intake (180g daily) combined with the training volume seems to be working. No digestive issues with the fiber content. The Arabic coffee and qatayef became my favorite pre-evening ritual. Budget of 60 SAR/day was more than sufficient for quality ingredients. Body weight is up modestly as expected on a muscle gain protocol - mostly feeling fuller and slightly thicker in the upper body. No excessive bloating. Ready to continue into week two."

P07,2026-W21,11.9,35,90.6,2100,7.5,"Week one was challenging but eye-opening. The prescribed calorie target of around 2240 kcal/day is significantly below my maintenance needs for muscle gain at my training volume. As an advanced lifter training 5 days per week with intense sessions (chest, shoulders, arms, back, legs), I'm burning considerably more than this intake supports. I maintained 85% adherence - stuck to the meal plan most days, hit all 5 workouts hard. The food quality was excellent; foul medames and shawarma fit my macros well and my advanced cooking skills made prep easy. However, I felt energy dip mid-week during leg and back days. Recovery between sessions was noticeably slower than usual. Sleep stayed consistent at 7.5 hours. The deficit created some fat loss, but I'm also seeing strength plateau on compound lifts. For muscle gain goals, I'd need at least 3000-3200 kcal daily. The protein at roughly 100g/day is insufficient for my 91kg body weight and advanced training status - I typically aim for 180-200g.

The calorie target of 708 kcal for my first meal and around 2835 kcal total daily is severely insufficient for my muscle gain goal at my size and advanced training level. I'm 93.9 kg with advanced fitness doing 5 intense gym sessions weekly - I need at least 3500-4000 kcal to support muscle growth. Despite my 85% adherence propensity and advanced cooking skills, I found myself constantly hungry and fatigued. My lifts suffered mid-week, especially during the legs and back sessions. I stuck to about 80% of the plan because my body was screaming for more fuel, and I had to add extra protein shakes and snacks just to maintain energy. Sleep quality dropped slightly due to hunger. The meal quality was excellent - I enjoyed the Foul Medames and Chicken Kabsa - but portions were far too small. Without adequate calories, I actually lost weight and muscle instead of gaining. This deficit is more appropriate for aggressive fat loss, not muscle building for someone my size."
P07,2026-W28,11.7,36.1,93.9,2850,7.1,"Solid first week on the plan. I managed to stick to the meal prep about 85% of the time - the high protein targets were challenging on a couple of busy days, so I supplemented with protein shakes. The calorie surplus felt appropriate for muscle gain without excessive bloating. Workouts were intense and progressive; hit all 5 training days as scheduled. The advanced split targeting different muscle groups each session allowed for good recovery. Noticed improved pump during arm and shoulder sessions. Sleep was consistent around 7 hours, though I could benefit from an extra 30 minutes. The ful medames breakfast became a favorite - great energy for morning sessions. Only minor issue was sodium intake running slightly higher than target on days I ate out once. Overall energy levels were high, strength progressed on compound lifts, and recovery felt solid. Looking forward to continuing this momentum."

I did skip the hummus snack twice when I was rushing between work and the gym, grabbed protein shakes instead. Sleep was consistent around 7 hours, though I could probably benefit from an extra 30 minutes. Feeling fuller and noticing slight strength gains on bench press and deadlift.

I noticed better recovery between sessions, likely due to the increased caloric intake. The kabsa was delicious and easy to batch cook. Only struggled with hitting the exact fiber targets on two days when I was eating out. Energy levels were consistently high throughout the week, and I felt fuller than my previous cutting phase. Pumps in the gym were noticeably better by day 4-5. Sleep remained solid at 7 hours most nights, though I had one night at 6.5 hours due to late work commitment."

The shakshuka breakfast became a favorite and the mandi for dinner was incredible. Cooking skills definitely helped with meal prep efficiency. Sleep was consistent around 7 hours most nights, slightly better than my usual 6.9. Energy levels were high throughout the week, recovery felt good between sessions.

P08,2025-W46,32.1,23.35,71.8,1680,7,"This week was honestly harder than I expected. The meal plan itself wasn't too bad - I actually really liked the ful medames for breakfast, it kept me full for hours! But I have to admit I only stuck to the full plan about 4 days out of 7. On Wednesday I had a family gathering and ate way more kabsa than planned, and Friday night I went out with friends and had shawarma. The workouts were ROUGH. I'm a beginner and these advanced gym sessions were way too intense for me. I could barely complete half the exercises properly and felt intimidated in the gym. My form was probably terrible on most moves. I did show up for 3 out of the 4 planned sessions though, which I'm proud of. Skipped the last leg day because my thighs were still sore from earlier in the week. Sleep was okay, averaged around 7 hours but had trouble falling asleep after the intense workouts. I'm definitely feeling sore and tired, but also a bit accomplished. I think I need a more beginner-appropriate workout plan though."
P08,2025-W47,31.8,23.4,71.3,1847,6.7,"This week was a mixed bag for me. I started out motivated on Monday and Tuesday, hitting my workouts and sticking to the meal plan pretty well. The high-protein breakfasts really helped keep me full until lunch, which was great! But by Wednesday, I was already feeling sore from the workouts - my legs were killing me from those lunges and squats. I had to modify some exercises because they felt too advanced for where I'm at.

Mid-week got tougher. I managed to prep some meals on Sunday which helped, but my cooking skills are pretty basic so I kept things simple - lots of grilled chicken, rice, and veggies. Thursday I skipped the workout because I was still sore and honestly just tired. My sleep was okay most nights around 7 hours, but Friday I stayed up late with friends and only got like 5 hours.

The weekend was the hardest part. Saturday there was a birthday dinner and I completely went off plan - had pasta, cake, the works. I felt guilty but also it was nice to just enjoy myself. Sunday I tried to get back on track with eating but skipped the workout because I was catching up on errands and meal prep for the next week.

Overall, I'd say I stuck to the diet about 60% of the time - hit my calorie and protein goals Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and parts of Thursday. The workouts were tough - I completed 2 out of the 4 planned sessions fully, and did a partial third one. The exercises labeled W25 and W21 felt too intense for a beginner like me. I had to look up modifications online.

Positives: I definitely feel stronger even with the soreness, my energy was better on the days I ate well, and I learned I really need to meal prep to stay on track. The budget of 35 SAR per day was manageable when I cooked at home - chicken, eggs, and rice are affordable. Challenges: The DOMS was real and discouraging, social events are my weakness, and I need simpler workout progressions. I can see this working if I stick with it, but I need to be more realistic about my current fitness level."
P08,2025-W48,31.5,23.5,71,2045,6.8,"Week 48 is done and honestly, I'm feeling pretty drained. Started the week motivated after last week's decent results, but reality hit hard. The workouts are still really challenging for my beginner level - those W25 and W21 sessions have moves I'm not fully comfortable with yet. I managed to complete 3 out of 4 planned workouts this week, which is actually better than last week! Skipped Thursday because I had a terrible night's sleep Wednesday (only 5 hours) and my legs were screaming from Tuesday's session.

Diet-wise, I stuck to the plan about 4 days solidly. The 35 SAR budget is tight but doable when I meal prep. Monday through Wednesday went great - I'm getting better at the high-protein breakfast routine and it really does keep me fuller. Thursday and Friday were rough though. Thursday I was too tired to cook properly and grabbed a shawarma (way over my calories), and Friday I had a work lunch I couldn't control. Weekend was mixed - Saturday I got back on track, but Sunday evening I went to a friend's birthday dinner and definitely overate.

The DOMS is still real but not as bad as Week 47. My body is slowly adapting to the movement patterns. I'm seeing tiny changes in how my clothes fit around my waist, which keeps me going. The scale isn't moving much but I know that's normal. Sleep averaged slightly better this week at 6.8 hours, except for that one awful night.

Biggest wins: Actually completed 3 workouts, felt stronger on the second W25 session, and didn't completely derail on the weekend. Biggest struggles: Still intimidated by some exercises, energy levels mid-week, and social eating situations. The adherence propensity thing is real - I'm hovering right around that 60% mark naturally. Some days I'm all in, others I just can't push through the barriers.

Going into Week 49, I want to focus on getting all 4 workouts done and maybe prepping Sunday meals to avoid that end-of-weekend slip. Overall, not perfect but I'm learning and showing up more often than not."
P08,2025-W49,31.2,23.6,70.6,1847,6.8,"Week 49 was a mixed bag for me. I started strong on Monday and Tuesday, hitting my workouts and sticking to my meal prep. Wednesday I felt really tired from only getting 6 hours of sleep, so I skipped the gym but managed to eat reasonably well. Thursday and Friday were better - I got back on track with workouts and my energy improved. The weekend was harder though. Saturday I did my workout but went out with friends in the evening and definitely overate. Sunday I was too tired and sore to work out, plus I had family obligations that threw off my meal timing. Overall, I completed 3 out of 4 planned workouts (75% again), which I'm actually proud of given how tired I felt mid-week. Diet-wise, I'd say I stuck to my plan about 4 out of 7 days properly - the weekend social stuff and one day of fatigue eating got me. I'm noticing my DOMS isn't as bad as the first few weeks, which feels like progress. My clothes are fitting a tiny bit better around my waist, which keeps me motivated. The 35 SAR budget is working with meal prep, but I need to prep more snacks to avoid grabbing random things when I'm hungry. My form is getting better on exercises but I still feel like a beginner - had to ask for help on proper squat depth twice this week. Sleep averaged around 6.8 hours, which isn't great but typical for me with my schedule. I'm trying to be realistic - this 62% adherence thing is real. I'm not perfect but I'm showing up more often than not."
P08,2025-W50,30.9,23.7,70.2,2285,6.8,"Week 50 was a mixed bag but I'm genuinely proud of pushing through some tough moments. Monday started strong - I meal prepped on Sunday evening which made a HUGE difference. Hit my workout and felt energized despite the usual Monday blues. Tuesday was solid too, though I noticed my legs were still a bit sore from Monday's lower body work. Wednesday hit me like a truck again - this seems to be my weak point. Only got 6.2 hours of sleep Tuesday night because of work stress, and I could feel it in my bones. I skipped the workout but stayed mostly on track with food, though I did grab a shawarma wrap (about 150 kcal over budget) because I was too tired to cook my prepped meal properly.

Thursday I bounced back! Got a solid 7.1 hours of sleep and crushed my workout. I'm noticing my form is improving - the trainer at the gym even complimented my squat depth. That felt amazing. Friday was decent diet-wise but no workout scheduled, so I used it as active recovery and went for a 30-minute walk. Saturday was challenging - family gathering with SO much food. I tried to be mindful but definitely went over my calories (estimated 2800-3000 kcal). The guilt was real but I'm learning to be kinder to myself.

Sunday I got back on track with a great workout and clean eating. Meal prepped again for the upcoming week. My clothes are fitting even better now - my favorite jeans that were tight 2 weeks ago now button comfortably! The scale isn't moving as fast as I'd like, but I can see changes in the mirror and that keeps me going. DOMS is still present but much more manageable than the first few weeks. I'm starting to actually enjoy the challenge of lifting.

The 35 SAR budget continues to work well with meal prep. I'm getting better at buying in bulk and freezing portions. This week I made a big batch of chicken and rice with vegetables that lasted 4 days. Sleep is still my biggest struggle - averaging 6.8 hours but I really need to prioritize getting to bed earlier. When I sleep better, everything else falls into place."
P08,2025-W51,30.5,23.9,69.9,2145,6.8,"Week 51 was a mixed bag but honestly felt more sustainable than previous weeks. I hit 3 out of 4 workouts again (75%), which seems to be my sweet spot right now. The missed workout was Friday - I just completely ran out of steam after a brutal work week and only got 6.3 hours of sleep Thursday night. Diet adherence was about 4 out of 7 days (57%), pretty much my baseline pattern.

The wins: Monday and Wednesday workouts felt STRONG. I'm noticing I can push harder without feeling like I'm going to collapse, and my form on squats is finally clicking - the gym staff member who corrected me two weeks ago gave me a thumbs up this week! That felt amazing. Meal prep on Sunday was clutch again - having those containers ready made Tuesday and Wednesday so much easier. I'm also getting better at eyeballing portions and actually feeling satisfied rather than stuffed.

The struggles: Mid-week energy crash hit hard Wednesday evening (despite a good workout that morning). Thursday's diet went off the rails - grabbed fast food twice because I didn't prep and was too tired to cook. Friday I skipped the gym entirely and had a very 'whatever' eating day. Weekend was better - got back on track Saturday, but Sunday had a friend's birthday dinner that pushed me over my calories (probably around 2400-2500).

The interesting part: I'm noticing my jeans are looser in the waist even though the scale barely moved. My arms look more defined, and I caught myself flexing in the mirror (okay, maybe more than once). The psychological boost from visible changes is real - it makes the hard days feel more worth it.

Sleep averaged 6.8 hours, with Thursday being rough (6.3 hours) and Sunday being great (7.3 hours). I really notice the correlation between sleep and my ability to stick to both diet and workouts. When I'm tired, everything feels 10x harder.

Budget stayed solid at 35 SAR/day. Bulk chicken and rice continue to be my MVPs. Thursday's fast food splurge was about 45 SAR, but I balanced it by keeping other days cheaper.

Overall: I'm accepting that 3/4 workouts and 4/7 diet days might just be my realistic baseline right now with work stress and sleep challenges. The key insight this week was that I'm STILL making progress even without perfect adherence. My body is changing, I'm getting stronger, and I'm learning to be less all-or-nothing about it. That's actually huge for me."
P08,2025-W52,30.1,24.1,69.7,2089,6.8,"Week 52 was a solid continuation of my journey, though the holiday week energy definitely tested me. Started strong Monday and Tuesday with meal prep carrying over from Sunday, which made hitting my macros so much easier. Wednesday's mid-week crash hit right on schedule - I could feel that familiar energy dip around 3pm, but I pushed through the workout anyway, even if the last set of squats felt heavier than usual. Thursday was tough; only got 6.4 hours of sleep and seriously considered skipping the gym, but remembering how good I felt after pushing through last week motivated me to go. Friday I actually skipped - my body was screaming for rest and I'm learning to listen to those signals without the guilt spiral. The weekend was interesting: Saturday I felt recharged and crushed my workout, really focusing on the form cues from the trainer. Sunday's diet went slightly over because of a family gathering (around 2300 kcal), but I made conscious choices and didn't feel out of control like I might have a few months ago. Overall, I'm seeing more definition in my shoulders and my jeans are fitting looser around the waist even though the scale barely moved. The mental shift of accepting 'good enough' instead of 'perfect' is probably my biggest win this week."
P08,2026-W01,29.8,24.3,69.5,2147,6.9,"Week 1 of 2026 complete! Overall feeling pretty proud of how I navigated this week. Started strong with Monday's workout - W25 felt challenging but manageable, and my deadlift form is really clicking now. Tuesday's diet was spot-on, meal prep from Sunday carried me through beautifully. Wednesday I hit W21 and noticed my endurance is definitely improving on the cardio intervals. 

Thursday was tougher - only got 6.3 hours of sleep and felt it during the day. Still managed to stick to my meals but energy was dragging. Skipped the planned Thursday workout and moved it to Friday instead, which turned out to be a good call. Friday's W25 session felt strong after better sleep (7.2 hours Thursday night). 

Weekend was a mixed bag. Saturday's W21 workout done, but I had a work social event Saturday evening that pushed me over budget - estimated around 2450 kcal for the day. Didn't stress about it though, just enjoyed the evening and got back on track Sunday. Sunday meal prep set me up well again, hit my targets.

Sleep averaged 6.9 hours this week (range 6.3-7.4), which is slightly above my usual 6.8. Definitely notice the correlation between better sleep and better adherence. Completed 4/4 planned workouts (100% adherence!) though I shifted Thursday to Friday. Diet adherence was 5/7 days (71%) - Thursday I was about 150 kcal over from an extra snack when tired, and Saturday was the social event.

Body feels good - slight DOMS in glutes and hamstrings after Friday's deadlifts, but nothing excessive. Waist feels slightly tighter in a good way, and I'm noticing more definition in my shoulders when I look in the mirror. Scale weight pretty stable which I expected with recomp focus.

Budget averaged 33 SAR/day (Saturday social was shared costs, so didn't blow the budget). Feeling confident about the intermediate program transition coming up - maybe in 3-4 weeks if this momentum continues. One challenge this week was managing hunger on that low-sleep Thursday, but I'm learning that sometimes an extra 100-150 kcal of protein is better than white-knuckling through cravings."
P08,2026-W02,29.5,24.4,69.3,2143,6.8,"Week 2 of 2026 complete! This week was a reality check after my perfect workout week last time. I managed 3 out of 4 planned workouts (75% adherence), which honestly feels okay given how exhausted I was mid-week. My sleep averaged 6.8 hours - slightly down from last week's 6.9, and I really felt it on Wednesday and Thursday.

Diet-wise, I hit about 4.5 out of 7 days properly (64% adherence), which is a small dip from last week's 71%. Monday and Tuesday were solid - I meal prepped Sunday night and stuck to my 2051 kcal target. Wednesday was chaos at work, and I ended up grabbing a shawarma wrap that pushed me to around 2400 kcal. Thursday I compensated and came in under at 1850, but then Friday I was so tired I stress-snacked on dates and nuts, probably hit 2200.

The weekend was mixed. Saturday I did W25 (full body strength) and felt strong, but then had a friend's birthday gathering in the evening. I budgeted for it mentally and enjoyed myself - probably 2500 kcal for the day but no guilt this time. Sunday I got back on track with a solid 2000 kcal day and my W21 cardio/core session.

Skipped Thursday's planned workout because I only got 6.2 hours sleep Wednesday night and my legs were still sore from Monday's session. I'm learning to listen to my body better. The workout I did skip was W21, so I made it up Sunday instead of resting completely.

Budget held at 35 SAR/day average. I'm getting better at shopping - found a great deal on chicken breast and bought in bulk, froze portions. My beginner cooking skills are improving; I can now make a decent stir-fry without burning the garlic!

Physically, I feel like I'm maintaining the positive body recomp signs from last week. My jeans fit the same (good), and I think I see a bit more definition in my shoulders when I flex. Scale weight is basically stable which is what I want while losing fat and building muscle.

Form improvements continuing on exercises. I filmed myself doing goblet squats and realized my knees were caving in slightly - worked on that this week. My beginner status means every session I learn something new about my body.

Mentally, I'm in a good place. Not beating myself up over the imperfect adherence because I'm seeing this as a lifestyle change, not a sprint. The 62% adherence propensity I have feels accurate - I'm consistent enough to see progress but human enough to live my life.

Goals for next week: try to hit all 4 workouts, get 7+ hours sleep at least 3 nights, and maybe push diet adherence back up to 70%. One day at a time!"
P08,2026-W03,29.3,24.5,69.1,1950,6.7,"This week felt like a mixed bag honestly. I started strong on Monday and Tuesday with my workouts and meal prep, but by Wednesday I was already feeling the fatigue creep in from poor sleep (only got about 6.5 hours most nights). I managed to hit 3 out of my 4 planned workouts which I'm actually proud of given how tired I was mid-week. Thursday I completely skipped because I just couldn't face another workout after a rough night's sleep - my body was screaming for rest.

Diet-wise, I did okay but not great. I stuck to my meal plan about 60% of the time. Monday through Wednesday were solid, then Thursday and Friday I had some unplanned snacks and ate out once which pushed me over my calorie target. The weekend was better - I got back on track Saturday and Sunday, though I did have a small treat on Saturday evening which I don't regret because it kept me sane.

The workouts themselves felt good when I did them. I'm really focusing on my goblet squat form like my notes said - keeping my knees tracking properly over my toes. I can feel my legs getting stronger even though the scale hasn't moved much. W25 (the full body strength days) are still challenging but I'm getting more comfortable with the movements. W21 (the cardio/circuit days) leave me completely wiped but in a good way.

Budget stayed right around 35 SAR per day which I'm happy about. I've gotten better at buying basics in bulk and meal prepping simple things. My cooking is still pretty basic but functional.

Overall, I'd say this was a realistic week - not perfect, but I showed up more than I didn't, and that's what matters. I'm learning to listen to my body better about rest days versus just being lazy. The scale barely moved but I feel like my clothes fit slightly better, especially around my thighs and waist. My energy levels are still not great due to sleep, but I'm working on it."
P08,2026-W04,29,24.6,68.8,2045,6.6,"This week was a mixed bag, honestly. I started strong with good intentions after last week's reflection, but reality hit hard mid-week. Monday and Tuesday felt great - I nailed my workouts and stuck to my meal prep. The W25 workout on Monday was challenging but manageable, and I really felt my form improving on those goblet squats. Wednesday was where things started to slip. I completed the W21 workout but felt more fatigued than usual, probably because my sleep was still hovering around 6.5 hours. I tried going to bed earlier but kept waking up around 3am for no reason.

Thursday was supposed to be another W25 day, but I woke up exhausted and with a slight headache. I made the call to skip it rather than risk injury or burnout - learning from last week's lesson about listening to my body. Diet-wise, Thursday turned into a bit of a disaster. I was stressed about a work deadline and ended up grabbing fast food for lunch and snacking more than planned in the evening. Probably went over by 400 calories.

Friday's W21 workout happened but felt sluggish. My energy was low and I had to reduce the weight on a couple of exercises. I did finish though, which I'm proud of. Saturday I bounced back - good workout (W25 again) and clean eating. Sunday was a rest day and I focused on meal prep for the coming week, which always makes me feel more in control.

Diet adherence was around 55-60% this week - I hit my targets on Monday, Tuesday, Saturday, and mostly on Sunday (4 out of 7 days). Wednesday I was slightly over, Thursday was way over, and Friday I was under because I felt a bit nauseous after the workout and didn't eat enough at dinner. My budget held steady at about 34-36 SAR per day. I'm getting better at finding affordable protein sources - found chicken breast on sale and stocked up.

Sleep averaged 6.6 hours this week, which is slightly worse than last week's 6.7. The mid-week insomnia really threw me off. I need to figure out what's causing those 3am wake-ups. Maybe too much screen time before bed?

Completed 3 out of 4 planned workouts (75% adherence, same as last week). The scale showed a tiny drop, but I'm trying not to obsess over it since I know weight fluctuates. My jeans feel a tiny bit looser in the waist, which is encouraging. Overall, I feel like I'm maintaining rather than making huge progress, but I'm being realistic - this is a marathon, not a sprint. Next week I really need to prioritize sleep and maybe try some relaxation techniques before bed."
P08,2026-W05,28.7,24.7,68.5,2038,7.1,"Week 5 complete and honestly, I'm feeling pretty good about how I handled things this time. Started strong with the sleep hygiene protocol - put my phone away by 10pm most nights and that made a real difference. Monday and Tuesday were solid workout days (W25 and W21), felt energized and my form on goblet squats is really clicking now. Wednesday's W25 was tough though - only got 6.2 hours sleep and felt it during the workout, but I pushed through at maybe 80% intensity.

Diet-wise, I managed 5 out of 7 days on target which is an improvement! The meal prep on Sunday really paid off. Thursday was my planned concern day and I actually nailed it - prepped a satisfying chicken and rice bowl that hit my macros and didn't trigger any stress eating. That felt like a real win. Friday I was slightly under calories (about 120 kcal) because I had a busy day and just wasn't as hungry, but Saturday I made up for it.

Sunday's W21 workout felt strong - I'm definitely getting better at the push-up progressions and can feel my shoulders getting more stable. The scale barely moved but my jeans are fitting noticeably better around the waist and thighs, which is more motivating than numbers anyway.

Sleep averaged 7.1 hours this week - huge improvement from last week's 6.6! Only had one night of poor sleep (Tuesday, 6.0 hours with a 2am waking) but recovered well. The screen curfew and some breathing exercises before bed really helped. Budget stayed right on track at 34-35 SAR/day by shopping sales and sticking to my grocery list.

Challenges: Wednesday's workout was a mental battle with the fatigue, and I had some cravings Saturday evening but managed them with a planned higher-calorie day. My energy levels were so much better this week overall - clearly sleep is my key factor.

Wins: Better sleep consistency, improved diet adherence, all 4 planned workouts completed, no stress eating incidents, visible body composition changes, and I'm starting to actually enjoy the workouts instead of just grinding through them.

For next week: Keep the sleep protocol going, maybe add 10 minutes to my warm-ups since I'm noticing better workout quality when I take time to properly prep, and continue the Thursday meal prep strategy since it worked so well."
P08,2026-W06,28.5,24.8,68.2,1993,7.1,"Week 6 complete! This was a solid week overall with some real-world challenges that tested my consistency. I managed 3 out of 4 planned workouts (75% adherence), which honestly feels like a win given the circumstances. Diet adherence landed at 57% (4/7 days on target) - not my best week, but I handled the slip-ups better mentally than I would have a month ago.

Monday started strong with W25 workout - I extended my warm-up by 10 minutes as planned and it made a HUGE difference. My goblet squats felt so much more stable, and I was able to add 2kg to the weight. My shoulder press form is improving too; I can feel the mind-muscle connection developing. Sleep was excellent at 7.4 hours, and I woke up energized.

Tuesday's W21 workout was good but not great. I hit all the exercises but my energy dipped around the 30-minute mark. Diet was on point though - 1,985 kcal with my meal prep working perfectly. Sleep was 7.2 hours but I had one brief waking around 1am (stress about a work deadline).

Wednesday is where things got tricky. I had an unexpected family obligation that ran late, and I ended up eating out. I tried to make smart choices but definitely went over by about 250 kcal. No workout either. Sleep suffered at 6.3 hours because I got home late and my mind was racing. This is exactly the kind of disruption that would have derailed me completely before, but I told myself one day doesn't erase progress.

Thursday I bounced back! Did my meal prep as usual, hit 1,995 kcal perfectly, and got 7.5 hours of sleep. My screen curfew at 10pm is becoming automatic now. I also did my W25 workout and felt STRONG. The previous day's rest might have actually helped because I crushed my dumbbell rows with better form than ever.

Friday was another diet miss - I was genuinely exhausted (probably catching up from Wednesday) and my appetite was all over the place. I ended up about 180 kcal under target at around 1,820 kcal. Just wasn't hungry and didn't want to force it. Sleep was good at 7.3 hours though, which I think my body needed.

Saturday I planned as a slightly higher day and hit about 2,150 kcal - felt intentional and satisfying, not like a binge. No workout scheduled. Sleep was 6.8 hours (stayed up a bit later socializing but felt okay).

Sunday I was supposed to do W21 but I woke up with the start of a headache and my lower back felt tight. I made the decision to skip it rather than risk poor form or injury. I've learned that rest is productive too. Diet was on target at 2,010 kcal, and I prioritized sleep at 7.6 hours.

Physically, I'm seeing continued changes. My jeans are noticeably looser in the waist, and I can see more definition in my shoulders and upper back. The scale barely moved (down 0.3kg) but I KNOW body recomposition is happening. My measurements tell a different story than the scale. I'm getting stronger - that 2kg added to goblet squats is proof.

The budget stayed tight at 34-35 SAR/day except for Wednesday's unplanned meal out (hit about 42 SAR that day). I'm getting really good at finding sales and stretching ingredients.

Mentally, I'm in a good place. I didn't spiral after missing workouts or going over calories. That's HUGE growth for me. I'm learning to be consistent without being perfect. The sleep protocol is my secret weapon - when I sleep well, everything else falls into place.

For next week, I want to get back to 4/4 workouts and tighten up diet adherence to 70%+. I'll keep the extended warm-ups and maybe add 5 minutes of mobility work on rest days. My body is responding really well to this program, and I'm excited to keep building momentum."
P08,2026-W07,28,25,67.7,1995,7.2,"Week 7 was a solid return to form after last week's minor disruptions. I managed to hit all 4 planned workouts (100% adherence!) which felt amazing - that mental shift from last week about not spiraling really paid off. Monday and Thursday's W25 sessions were challenging but I'm loving the progressive overload strategy. Added another 1.5kg to goblet squats and my form felt locked in. The extended warm-up continues to be a game-changer for my performance and joint comfort.

Tuesday and Saturday's W21 workouts provided good active recovery while still pushing cardio capacity. My endurance is noticeably improving - what felt breathless 2 weeks ago now feels manageable.

Diet adherence landed at 71% (5/7 days on target) - a significant improvement from last week's 57%! I successfully implemented those contingency meals: prepped overnight oats and grabbed pre-portioned hummus packs which saved me on busy days. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Sunday I hit my calorie targets within 50 kcal. Wednesday I went over by about 180 kcal (colleague's birthday cake at work - worth it for team morale, no regrets), and Saturday I was under by about 200 kcal due to a busy morning that pushed lunch late and I just wasn't as hungry.

Budget stayed solid at 33-36 SAR/day. The meal prep strategy is really working - buying in bulk and cooking simple recipes keeps costs down while hitting nutrition goals.

Sleep averaged 7.2 hours (range: 6.8-7.5h), which is consistent with my baseline. Wednesday was the lowest at 6.8h due to staying up to finish a work project, but I recovered well. I'm noticing that when I get 7+ hours, my workout performance and appetite regulation are significantly better.

Body composition changes are becoming more visible! My clothes fit differently - looser around the waist, tighter (in a good way) around shoulders and upper back. The scale moved down slightly but I can see muscle definition emerging, especially in my arms and upper back. The mirror progress is more motivating than the scale honestly.

I added 5-minute mobility work on rest days (Wednesday, Friday, Sunday) focusing on hip flexors, thoracic spine, and ankle mobility. This felt great and I think it's contributing to better workout quality and the absence of any niggles or soreness.

Psychologically, I'm in a really good place. That Wednesday cake situation? Old me would have felt guilty and maybe skipped Thursday's workout as 'punishment.' New me enjoyed the cake, logged it honestly, and crushed Thursday's session. This mental flexibility is the real progress.

Minor challenges: Wednesday's late work night affected my sleep and I felt a bit sluggish Thursday morning, but I pushed through. Saturday's hunger timing was off, but I listened to my body rather than forcing food.

Action items for W08: maintain 4/4 workout completion, aim for 75%+ diet adherence, continue mobility work on rest days, consider increasing weight on dumbbell rows next week, keep prioritizing 7+ hours sleep, maybe experiment with a new protein-rich recipe to keep meals interesting."
P08,2026-W08,27.4,25.1,67.3,2038,7.2,"Week 8 was a solid continuation of my fitness journey with some interesting challenges and wins. I maintained my 4-workout schedule (W25 Monday, W21 Tuesday, W25 Thursday, W21 Saturday) and hit all sessions at 100% adherence again, which I'm really proud of. The progressive overload on goblet squats continued - I added another 1kg this week and my form felt stable throughout.

Diet adherence came in at 71% (5/7 days), which matches my typical pattern. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Sunday were right on target around 2050 kcal. Wednesday was challenging - we had a team lunch at work for a colleague's promotion, and I went over by about 200 kcal with some kunafa dessert. I made a conscious choice to enjoy it without guilt, and I'm learning that these social moments are part of sustainable living. Saturday I was under by roughly 180 kcal because I got caught up in errands and ate lunch quite late, which threw off my appetite for the rest of the day.

Sleep averaged 7.2 hours (range 6.9-7.6h), pretty consistent with my baseline. Tuesday night was the shortest at 6.9 hours due to staying up watching a series, but I recovered well. My energy levels were good throughout the week, even on the days following shorter sleep.

I continued the 5-minute mobility work on rest days (Wednesday, Friday, Sunday), focusing on hip flexors, thoracic spine, and ankle mobility. This has become a habit I genuinely look forward to - it helps me feel less stiff and more prepared for the next workout.

Body composition changes are becoming more noticeable. My clothes are fitting differently - looser around the waist, slightly tighter in the shoulders and arms in a good way. I can see more definition in my shoulders and upper back when I look in the mirror. The scale moved down slightly, but more importantly, I feel stronger and more capable.

Budget stayed well-controlled at 33-37 SAR/day through continued meal prep. I made a big batch of grilled chicken, brown rice, and roasted vegetables on Sunday that carried me through most of the week. The workplace lunch on Wednesday was covered by the company, so that actually saved me money that day.

Psychologically, I'm in a great place. I didn't beat myself up over Wednesday's overage or Saturday's underage - I just noted them and moved on. This mental flexibility is something I've worked hard on, and it's paying off. I'm not obsessing over perfection; I'm building sustainable habits.

The workouts themselves felt strong. W25 sessions (Monday and Thursday) with their emphasis on compound movements are getting noticeably easier in terms of cardiovascular demand, though the weights are progressing. W21 sessions (Tuesday and Saturday) continue to challenge my upper body, which is my weaker area, but I'm seeing steady improvements in push-up form and dumbbell press weight.

Looking ahead, I want to maintain this momentum. No injuries, no burnout, just consistent progress. I'm considering adding a fifth workout day in a few weeks, but for now, four days feels sustainable and effective."
P08,2026-W09,26.9,25.2,66.9,2048,7.1,"Week 9 complete! This week felt like a continuation of my momentum from Week 8, though I definitely had some real-life challenges that tested my consistency. The workouts went really well - I'm genuinely surprised at how much stronger I'm getting with the goblet squats and push-ups. I managed to add another kilogram to my goblet squats on Monday and Thursday, which felt amazing. My form is getting more solid too.

Diet-wise, I hit my targets on 4 out of 7 days, which is slightly lower than last week but honestly feels realistic given what happened. Saturday was a family gathering where my aunt made her famous kabsa, and I just couldn't say no - I probably went about 250 calories over, but it was worth it for the family time. Wednesday I was running late for work and skipped my morning snack, ending up about 150 calories under target. The other days I was pretty much spot-on.

Sleep was decent overall at 7.1 hours average, though Friday night I only got 6.7 hours because of a late work project deadline. I could feel the fatigue during Saturday's workout, but I pushed through. My meal prep game is getting stronger - I'm now comfortable batch-cooking three different protein sources on Sunday, which gives me more variety during the week.

The best part? My jeans are fitting noticeably looser around the waist, and I can see more definition in my shoulders when I look in the mirror. A colleague even asked if I've been working out, which was such a confidence boost! I'm learning to be flexible with my diet without feeling guilty - that Saturday kabsa didn't derail me, I just got back on track Sunday.

Budget stayed solid at around 34 SAR/day. I'm getting better at finding deals on chicken breast and buying seasonal vegetables. Energy levels were good most days except that post-Friday-night situation. No injuries or pain, just some normal muscle soreness after leg days that feels productive rather than concerning.

Looking forward to Week 10 - I want to try adding some incline to my walking warm-ups and maybe experiment with a new protein recipe I found online."
P08,2026-W10,26.3,25.3,66.3,1950,7.2,"This week was challenging but I'm proud I stuck with it most days! The meal prep was harder than I expected - hummus and baba ganoush were easy to find, but cooking the kabsa took longer than I thought. I managed to follow the diet about 60% of the time, sometimes grabbing easier options when I was tired. The workouts were INTENSE - I've never done advanced level training before and honestly had to scale back some exercises. My legs were so sore after the first leg day that I almost skipped the second workout, but I pushed through with lighter weights. I'm sleeping about the same, maybe slightly better from being more tired. I can feel some changes in my energy levels and my clothes fit just a tiny bit better. The budget worked out okay since I cooked at home most days."
P08,2026-W11,25.6,25.4,65.7,2050,7.1,"This week was challenging but I managed to stick with it most days. The meal plan was actually pretty tasty - I loved the ful medames for breakfast, it kept me full for hours! I did struggle a bit with the fruit salad snack because I'd forget to prep it in the morning. The chicken shawarma and grilled fish were delicious. I followed the diet about 60-65% of the time - had a couple of days where I grabbed fast food with friends and one day I was too tired to cook the fish so I had something simpler. The workouts were TOUGH. I'm a beginner and these advanced gym sessions really pushed me. I could only complete about half the exercises at the recommended intensity, and I had to skip one leg day because I was too sore. My upper body is definitely feeling it! I did manage 4 workout sessions total though. Sleep stayed pretty consistent around 7 hours. I'm feeling a bit more energetic and my clothes fit slightly better. Looking forward to next week but hoping the workouts get easier as I build strength."
P08,2026-W12,25.2,25.5,65.3,2280,7,"This first week was challenging but I managed to stick with it most days. The shakshuka breakfast was delicious and easy to make, which helped a lot. I followed the meal plan about 60-65% of the time - some days I grabbed quick snacks or ate out with friends. The gym workouts were really intense for my beginner level, especially the advanced upper body and legs sessions. I had to modify several exercises and use lighter weights than prescribed. My muscles were very sore, particularly after the leg day. I noticed I was hungrier than usual, probably from the workouts, so I had a few extra snacks mid-week. The fattoush salad was refreshing but didn't keep me full for long. Overall, I'm proud I made it through the week even though it was tough!"
P08,2026-W13,24.6,25.6,64.7,2050,7.2,"This week was challenging but I'm proud I stuck with it most days! The meal prep was harder than I expected - I'm still learning to cook and the Chicken Kabsa took me forever the first time. I managed to follow the diet about 60-65% of the time. Some days I grabbed easier options or ate out with friends. The workouts were TOUGH - I realized 'Advanced' level was way above my beginner fitness. I could only complete about half the exercises properly and had to modify or skip some. My muscles were super sore, especially after the leg day. I did all 4 workout days though! The hummus breakfast became my favorite - super easy. The date smoothie was delicious and kept me full. I noticed I'm sleeping a bit better, maybe from the exercise. I'm a little discouraged the workouts were so hard, but I can see this working if I keep at it."
P08,2026-W14,24,25.7,64.1,2020,7.1,"This week was challenging but I tried my best! The calorie target felt really low at 536 kcal for the first meal - I was honestly starving by mid-morning most days. I managed to stick to the plan about 60% of the time, but on 3 days I added extra snacks because I felt dizzy and couldn't focus at work. The workouts were WAY too advanced for me as a beginner - the upper body and legs gym sessions were labeled 'Advanced' and I could barely complete half the exercises. I had to modify a lot and skip some entirely. I did make it to the gym 3 out of the 4 planned days though! The ful medames breakfast was actually really tasty and easy to make, and I loved the mandi for dinner. The baklava was a nice treat. I'm feeling a bit more energetic toward the end of the week and I think I'm starting to see small changes. My sleep stayed pretty consistent around 7 hours."
P08,2026-W15,23.4,25.7,63.5,2180,7,This week was challenging but I'm proud I stuck with it most days! The shakshuka became my favorite breakfast - so flavorful and filling. I managed to prep it 4 times this week. The grilled chicken salad was easy once I figured out the grill pan. I did skip the lentil soup twice because I got home late and just wasn't up for cooking. On those days I grabbed a protein shake and some fruit instead. The workouts were TOUGH - I've never done advanced level before and honestly had to scale back some exercises. The upper body day left me sore for 3 days! I completed all 4 workout days but definitely modified the weights and reps. My adherence was around 60-65% on the diet - I had a dinner out with friends on Friday where I went over my calories. Sleep stayed pretty consistent around 7 hours. I'm feeling slightly leaner in my clothes and have more energy in the mornings. The meal plan is doable but I need to work on my meal prep skills to stay more consistent.

I followed the diet about 60% of the time - some days I had to grab something quick when I didn't prepare ahead. The workouts were REALLY intense for my beginner level. The advanced upper body and legs sessions left me super sore, so I completed maybe 3 out of the 4 planned sessions, and even then I had to modify some exercises or use lighter weights. I'm definitely feeling it in my muscles though! My energy dipped mid-week, probably because the calorie target felt a bit high and I wasn't always hitting my protein goals. Sleep stayed pretty consistent around 7 hours. I can see small changes already which is motivating, but I need to work on my meal prep skills to stay more consistent."

My legs were so sore after the first leg day that I had to take an extra rest day. I'd say I followed the meal plan about 60-65% of the time. A couple of nights I ended up eating out with friends and went over my calories. The date energy balls were a lifesaver for sweet cravings though!

My legs were so sore after the first leg day that I could barely walk for two days! I followed the meal plan about 60-65% of the time. A couple nights I ended up eating out with friends and went over my calories. The luqaimat dessert was a nice treat that kept me from feeling too restricted. I did notice I'm sleeping a bit better, maybe from being more tired from the workouts. The peanut butter and apple snack became my favorite - so simple and satisfying. I feel like I'm starting to see some definition in my arms which is motivating! Need to work on my meal prep skills to stay more consistent next week."

I could only complete about half the exercises at lower weights, and my form probably wasn't perfect. My muscles were really sore, especially after the leg day. I skipped one workout day because I was too exhausted. The shrimp meals were a bit pricey but stayed within budget by shopping at the local market. I noticed I'm sleeping better, probably from the exercise fatigue. Feeling a bit leaner around my waist and my energy is more stable throughout the day.

Had to really push through that second upper body session on Thursday, felt some good fatigue building up. The diet was surprisingly filling with all that protein, especially the kabsa and jareesh meals. I'd say I stuck to the plan about 70-75% of the time - had a couple meals where I eyeballed portions rather than measuring exactly, and grabbed an extra coffee with milk here and there. The ful medames breakfast became my favorite, very satisfying and kept me full until the labneh snack.

P09,2025-W47,18,28.85,72.6,2425,6.93,"This week went quite well overall. I managed to stick to the meal plan about 70-75% of the time, which feels realistic given my work schedule and social commitments. The 2456 kcal target felt appropriate for my recomposition goal - I wasn't overly hungry but also wasn't stuffed. I completed all 4 scheduled workouts (W25 upper body twice, W21 legs twice) as planned on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. The upper body sessions were challenging but manageable, and leg days left me with good DOMS that lasted about 36 hours each time.

On Tuesday and Thursday, I had slightly smaller portions at dinner due to late meetings, probably hitting around 2200-2300 kcal those days. Saturday I went a bit over - maybe 2650 kcal - as I had a family gathering with kabsa and couldn't resist seconds. The traditional Saudi meals actually worked great with my macros when I measured portions properly. My homemade hummus and grilled chicken became staples.

Sleep was consistent around 7 hours most nights, though Wednesday I only got 6.5 hours due to work stress. Energy levels were solid throughout - no crashes or extreme fatigue. The 50 SAR daily budget was sufficient; I spent about 320 SAR for the week on groceries and meal prep ingredients. Recovery felt good, and I'm noticing slightly better definition in my shoulders and chest. Weight stayed relatively stable with minor fluctuations, which is exactly what I want during recomposition.

Started Monday strong with W25 (Upper Power) - felt good hitting the compound movements, though the bench press was challenging on the last set. Tuesday was a rest day, managed meal prep for the week which helped with adherence. Wednesday's W21 (Lower Hypertrophy) left me with solid DOMS in quads and glutes that lasted until Friday morning. Thursday I had a work deadline that pushed dinner late, ended up at around 2650 kcal that day with an extra serving of kabsa at a family gathering. Friday's second W25 session felt stronger than Monday - added 2.5kg to my rows. Saturday's final W21 workout was tough on fatigued legs but pushed through. Sunday rest day was needed. Overall, I'm pleased with consistency - hit all 4 planned workouts despite the busy work week. Sleep was mostly good except Wednesday night when I only got 6.5 hours due to the DOMS discomfort. Protein targets were easy to meet with grilled chicken, lamb, and Greek yogurt. Budget came in at approximately 315 SAR for the week, well under my 350 SAR allocation. Two days I was slightly under calories (~2250 kcal) on Tuesday and Sunday as I wasn't as hungry. The traditional Saudi meals integrated perfectly - kabsa on Thursday, grilled lamb kebabs twice, hummus and whole wheat pita as snacks. No injuries or major barriers. Weight stable at 72.6kg but I'm noticing slightly better definition in my shoulders and upper chest. Strength gains are subtle but present, especially in pulling movements. The recomposition goal feels on track."

Monday and Wednesday's upper body sessions (W25) went well—I hit my target reps on bench press and overhead press, though shoulder stability felt slightly off on Wednesday, probably from the shorter sleep Sunday night. Friday's leg day (W25 again) brought the expected DOMS by Saturday morning, but I pushed through Saturday's W21 workout anyway. That back-to-back intensity was tough, and I had to dial back the weight on deadlifts slightly to maintain form.

Diet adherence hovered around 72% as expected. Tuesday I overshot calories by about 200 kcal—grabbed an extra shawarma wrap after work because I was starving and didn't prep enough lunch. Thursday had some meal timing chaos; I ended up eating dinner at 10 PM due to a late meeting, which messed with my digestion and next morning's energy. The other five days I nailed the ~2450 kcal target, keeping protein between 150-160g daily with chicken, eggs, Greek yogurt, and whey. Fiber was consistently around 22g from oats, vegetables, and some fruit.

Sleep averaged 6.9 hours, with one particularly rough night (6.5 hours on Thursday) that left me dragging Friday morning. I noticed my recovery felt slower this week compared to when I get 7.5+ hours. DOMS in quads and glutes peaked Sunday/Monday after Friday's squats and lunges, but manageable with stretching and foam rolling.

Budget-wise, I spent approximately 320 SAR—slightly over my 315 SAR weekly target due to that unplanned shawarma and some extra chicken breast I needed mid-week. No injuries, which is a win. Strength is incrementally improving; added 2.5kg to my squat working sets and felt more stable in the hole. Body composition feels subtly better—abs are slightly more visible in morning light, and my shirts fit a bit tighter around the shoulders. The recomp process is slow but noticeable. Overall, a B+ week. Need to tighten up meal prep and prioritize an extra 30 minutes of sleep to hit A-level consistency."
P09,2025-W50,17.52,29.12,72.35,2446,7.1,"Week 50 was a solid continuation of my recomp journey, though I felt the cumulative fatigue from the previous week's sleep debt carrying over into Monday and Tuesday. I managed all 4 scheduled workouts (Mon/Wed/Fri/Sat: W25, W21, W25, W21) as planned, which felt like a win given my energy levels early in the week.

Monday's W25 upper session started sluggish—my bench press felt heavy, and I had to really focus on bar path to maintain form. I hit the prescribed reps but didn't feel explosive. Wednesday's W21 lower session was better; I kept the squat progression modest (+2.5kg on working sets) and felt more controlled. Friday's W25 upper was where I hit my stride—added a small increment to overhead press and nailed all sets with good tempo. Saturday's W21 lower left me with moderate DOMS in quads and glutes by Sunday, but nothing debilitating.

Nutrition was mostly on point. I meal-prepped Sunday evening (chicken breast, jasmine rice, mixed veggies, eggs, Greek yogurt) which kept me consistent Mon–Wed. Thursday I had a work meeting run late, so dinner was pushed to 9:30 PM—still hit macros but felt bloated before bed. Friday I intentionally added an extra snack post-workout (banana + whey) because I was ravenous, which bumped me to ~2480 kcal. Saturday I celebrated a friend's birthday with a small dessert (kunafa), pushing the day to ~2590 kcal. Sunday I dialed back slightly to ~2380 kcal to balance the week. Protein stayed in the 150–162g range daily, which I'm happy with.

Sleep improved compared to last week—averaged 7.1 hours, with only one night dipping to 6.6 hours (Thursday, likely due to the late dinner). I felt more recovered overall, and my gym performance reflected that. Budget came in at ~318 SAR for the week, just under my 350 SAR limit. I saved a bit by buying chicken in bulk and skipping one coffee shop visit.

Body composition feels like it's trending positively. I'm noticing more definition in my shoulders and upper chest, and my abs are more visible in morning light. Weight is stable around 72.3–72.5 kg, which aligns with recomp expectations. No injuries, though my lower back felt tight after Saturday's deadlifts—I foam-rolled and stretched, and it resolved by Monday.

Barriers this week: Thursday's late meeting disrupted my routine, and I felt mentally drained by Friday evening, which made meal prep for the weekend harder. I also struggled with cravings Saturday night after the birthday event, but I managed portion control. Overall adherence was around 74%, slightly better than last week's 72%. I'm learning to anticipate disruptions and plan buffer meals (e.g., quick omelets or canned tuna) for chaotic days.

Looking ahead, I want to tighten up meal timing on weekdays and maybe add a 10-minute mobility session post-workout to manage tightness. Strength is progressing steadily, and I'm feeling more confident in my form. The recomp process is slow but rewarding—I'm leaning out while maintaining strength, which is exactly what I wanted."
P09,2025-W51,17.28,29.25,72.15,2445,7.1,"Week 51 wrapped up with solid consistency overall. Started Monday fresh after the previous week's Saturday social event—body felt recovered and ready. The W25 upper session on Monday went smoothly, hitting all compound lifts with good form. Tuesday was a rest day with meal prep that set me up well for the midweek grind. Wednesday's W21 lower session was challenging but manageable; squats felt strong and I maintained the +2.5kg progression from last week. DOMS kicked in Thursday morning as expected, but nothing that interfered with daily activities.

Thursday evening I had a work commitment that pushed dinner later than planned (around 22:00), which cut into sleep—only got about 6.4 hours that night. Friday's W25 upper session still went well despite the slight fatigue; overhead press increments held steady. Post-workout hunger was real, and I ended up around 2465 kcal that day, slightly above target but within reason given the training volume.

Saturday's W21 lower session was the toughest of the week—deadlifts and Bulgarian split squats left my glutes and hamstrings screaming. I knew Sunday would be a recovery focus day. Saturday evening I attended a family gathering and while I tried to make smart choices, the calorie count crept up to about 2580 kcal. I didn't stress it too much since my adherence had been strong all week.

Sunday I dialed things back slightly, hitting around 2370 kcal and focusing on hydration and light stretching. The lower back tightness from deadlifts responded well to foam rolling sessions Sunday afternoon. Sleep averaged 7.1 hours for the week, which felt optimal—I noticed better recovery and mood compared to weeks when I dip below 7 hours.

Protein intake was consistent, ranging from 148g on the lower days to 161g on training days. I'm noticing continued improvements in body composition: shoulders and chest are more defined, and my abs are becoming more visible even without flexing. The scale showed a modest drop, but the mirror and how my clothes fit tell a better story.

Budget came in around 312 SAR for the week, comfortably under the 350 SAR limit. Meal prep on Tuesday and Friday evenings was key to staying on track. The Thursday late dinner situation reminded me I need to keep some quick, high-protein backup options at work for those unpredictable days.

Strength is progressing nicely—squat feels more stable, and I'm confident I can push another increment next week. Overhead press is always a grind, but the small wins add up. No injuries, and the DOMS pattern is predictable now, which helps with planning recovery strategies.

Overall adherence for the week was around 73%, factoring in the Thursday timing issue and Saturday's calorie overshoot. I'm pleased with how I managed the social event without completely derailing progress. The recomposition goal feels on track—I'm getting leaner while maintaining or slightly building muscle mass. Energy levels are good, and I'm sleeping better, which is probably the biggest win for sustainability.

Looking ahead to next week, I'll aim to tighten up Thursday meal timing and maybe prep an extra container to avoid the late-night scramble. Otherwise, the routine is working well, and I'm motivated to keep the momentum going."
P09,2025-W52,17.15,29.35,72.05,2489,7,"Week 52 was solid overall, though holiday distractions made it tougher than usual. Managed all 4 planned workouts (Mon W25, Wed W21, Fri W25, Sat W21) despite family commitments ramping up. Monday's upper session felt strong—overhead press moved well at the increased weight. Wednesday's lower day was efficient; squats felt stable and I'm holding the +2.5kg increment without form breakdown. Friday's upper repeat went smoothly, though I was slightly fatigued from a late Thursday night (only 6.5h sleep that night due to a work dinner running long). Saturday's lower session hit hard—DOMS kicked in Sunday and Monday, especially in quads and glutes. Foam rolling and extra stretching helped manage it.

Diet adherence was around 71-72% this week. Hit my calorie target (2370-2480 kcal range) on five days with protein consistently between 152-162g. Tuesday I went slightly over (~2590 kcal) at a family pre-Christmas gathering—lots of kabsa and desserts, hard to resist. Thursday's late work dinner also pushed me to ~2620 kcal, though protein was good (grilled chicken and rice). I kept meal prep strong for breakfast and lunch most days: overnight oats with protein powder, grilled chicken wraps, and veggie-heavy dinners. Snacking was controlled except Tuesday and Thursday.

Sleep averaged 7.0 hours this week, slightly below my usual 7.1h. Thursday's 6.5h and Saturday's 6.8h (stayed up watching a match) pulled the average down, but I compensated with a solid 7.5h on Sunday. Recovery felt adequate, though I could feel the impact of those shorter nights on Friday's workout energy levels.

Budget came in at ~318 SAR for the week, slightly over my usual ~312 SAR due to the work dinner (split the bill) and grabbing a couple of convenience meals mid-week when meal prep ran short. Still within reasonable limits.

Body composition is continuing to trend positively. Visually, I'm noticing more shoulder and chest definition, and my waist feels slightly tighter. The scale hasn't moved much, which is expected for recomp—trading fat for muscle slowly. Strength is holding steady; no major jumps this week, but maintaining the progressive overload on squats and overhead press is a win. I'm feeling good about the consistency despite the holiday chaos. Next week will be tougher with New Year's events, but I'm planning to stay flexible and hit at least 3 workouts."
P09,2026-W01,16.95,29.45,71.8,2458,7,"Week 1 of 2026 felt like a solid restart after the holiday period. Coming off last week's strong adherence (~72%), I approached this week with cautious optimism. The meal plan at ~2388 kcal matched my recomposition goals perfectly, and the 4-workout schedule (W25 and W21 alternating) felt manageable given my intermediate fitness level and 7-hour sleep average.

**Monday (Day 1 - W25 Upper):** Started strong with good energy. Meal prep from Sunday carried me through breakfast (oats, eggs) and lunch (chicken, rice, veggies). Hit the gym mid-morning—bench press felt solid, added 2.5kg to my working sets. Shoulder press was challenging but completed all reps. Calorie intake landed at ~2410 kcal, protein at 155g. Sleep was 7.2 hours. Budget: ~48 SAR (grocery leftovers + whey).

**Tuesday (Day 2 - W21 Lower):** Woke with mild upper-body soreness, nothing limiting. Lower session was brutal—squats at progressive load left my quads screaming. Romanian deadlifts hit hamstrings hard. Nutrition stayed on track: ~2395 kcal, 151g protein. Prepped meals held up. Sleep dipped to 6.7 hours due to work stress (project deadline looming). Budget: ~46 SAR.

**Wednesday (Day 3 - Rest/Active Recovery):** DOMS from Tuesday's lower session peaked today—stairs were a challenge. Did 20 minutes of foam rolling and a light walk (3km). Appetite was high, likely from recovery demands. Hit ~2450 kcal, 158g protein. Meal prep still holding but running low on chicken. Sleep recovered to 7.1 hours. Budget: ~44 SAR (used pantry staples).

**Thursday (Day 4 - W25 Upper):** Upper body session felt better than Monday—strength progression visible. Incline dumbbell press up 2kg per hand. Energy good despite moderate quad soreness lingering. Nutrition slipped slightly—grabbed a shawarma wrap at lunch (unplanned, ~150 kcal over budget) due to meeting running late. Total: ~2540 kcal, 153g protein. Sleep only 6.5 hours (late-night call with overseas client). Budget: ~57 SAR (shawarma splurge).

**Friday (Day 5 - W21 Lower):** Second lower session of the week. Squats felt heavier than Tuesday—fatigue from sleep deficit apparent. Completed workout but had to drop weight 5% on final squat set. Leg press and lunges were grindy. Post-workout hunger was intense. Evening social dinner (family gathering) pushed calories to ~2615 kcal, though protein stayed decent at 149g. Chose grilled meats, rice, salad—could've been worse. Sleep: 6.8 hours (late dinner). Budget: ~72 SAR (restaurant meal).

**Saturday (Day 6 - Rest):** Woke with severe DOMS in glutes and hamstrings—Friday's volume caught up. Foam rolled for 30 minutes, did yoga stretches. Appetite remained elevated. Stuck mostly to plan: ~2420 kcal, 156g protein. Meal prepped for Sunday and Monday. Sleep improved to 7.3 hours (caught up). Budget: ~53 SAR (grocery restock: chicken, veggies, oats).

**Sunday (Day 7 - Rest):** Recovery day felt restorative. Soreness down to manageable levels. Light cardio: 25-minute jog at easy pace. Nutrition dialed in: ~2375 kcal, 152g protein. Reflected on the week—4/4 workouts completed despite sleep inconsistencies and one social event. Strength gains modest but present. Body feels tighter around the waist, shoulders looking fuller. Sleep: 7.2 hours. Budget: ~42 SAR.

**Overall Reflections:** Completed all 4 scheduled workouts (100% adherence on training). Calorie intake averaged ~2458 kcal/day—slightly above target due to Thursday's shawarma and Friday's dinner, but only ~70 kcal/day over, which is acceptable for recomp. Protein averaged 153g/day (spot on). Sleep averaged 7.0 hours exactly, with two dips (Thursday, Friday) that impacted Friday's performance. Budget totaled ~362 SAR for the week, overshooting by ~12 SAR due to unplanned meals—need tighter control next week. 

Strength progression: upper body lifts up 2-2.5kg, lower body maintained despite fatigue. DOMS management improved with consistent foam rolling. Body composition: visually leaner in midsection, upper body fuller. Scale weight stable with slight downward trend (likely water/glycogen fluctuation). Adherence felt around 70-72%—hit workouts perfectly, nutrition 5/7 days on target, sleep 5/7 nights at goal.

**Barriers:** Work stress Thursday/Friday disrupted sleep and meal timing. Social dinner Friday was navigable but required conscious choices. Cooking fatigue mid-week led to Thursday's slip—batch cooking Sunday helped but need to prep more variety to avoid boredom.

**Positives:** Workout consistency excellent. Recovery protocols (foam rolling, active rest) effective. Protein intake rock-solid. Mental resilience good—didn't spiral after Thursday/Friday deviations.

**Next Week Focus:** Tighten budget (target <350 SAR). Prioritize sleep Thursday/Friday (decline late calls if possible). Pre-plan Thursday lunch to avoid takeout. Continue strength progression. Monitor waist measurements for recomp validation."
P09,2026-W02,16.65,29.6,71.5,2467,6.9,"Week 2 (2026-W02) complete. Started Monday strong with W25 upper workout - felt recovered from last week's DOMS. Hit all prescribed sets with slight progression on incline press (+2kg). Nutrition was dialed in Monday-Wednesday, meal prep from Sunday carried me through. Tuesday's W21 lower session was brutal - squats felt heavy but manageable, finished with good form. DOMS hit hard Wednesday morning in quads and glutes.

Mid-week got challenging. Thursday I slept only 6.3 hours due to a work deadline, which affected my energy for the second W25 upper session. Still completed it but dropped weight slightly on the last accessory exercises. Grabbed a quick shawarma on the way home (budget slip, ~45 SAR) which pushed me over calories to about 2580 kcal that day. Friday's W21 lower was scheduled but I was still sore from Tuesday - modified slightly, reduced squat volume by one set but maintained intensity. Sleep was 6.7 hours due to a cousin's late dinner gathering.

Weekend recovery was good. Saturday active rest with 20-minute walk, Sunday meal prepped for the coming week. Protein intake stayed consistent around 150-155g daily except Thursday (172g from the shawarma). Visually, I'm noticing continued improvements in upper chest and shoulder definition. Waist feels tighter, belt notch is definitely easier. Scale weight dropped slightly but I feel fuller in the mirror - classic recomp signals.

Budget came in at ~368 SAR for the week, about 18 SAR over target due to the shawarma and contributing to the family dinner. Sleep averaged 6.9 hours - need to protect those Thursday/Friday nights better. Adherence felt around 70% - hit all workouts but nutrition slipped twice and sleep wasn't optimal. The work stress is manageable but I need better boundaries. Overall solid week, strength is progressing, body composition trending right. Ready for Week 3."
P09,2026-W03,16.35,29.75,71.3,2537,6.8,"Week 3 felt like a grind in spots but overall solid. Started strong with meal prep on Sunday—chicken, rice, veggies all portioned out—which carried me through Monday and Tuesday. Workouts W25 and W21 hit hard; the upper-lower split is really clicking now, though DOMS from Tuesday's lower session lingered into Wednesday. Sleep took a hit midweek (Wednesday 6.4h, Thursday 6.5h) because of a project crunch at work and a late evening catching up with friends. That definitely affected my energy Thursday and Friday—felt sluggish during Friday's W25 session and had to drop weight slightly on back squats. Calorie adherence was decent: stuck to ~2500 kcal five days, but Wednesday I went over (~2620 kcal) grabbing a shawarma plate when meal prep ran short, and Saturday I hit ~2590 kcal at a family gathering. Protein averaged around 152g/day, close to target. Budget came in at ~372 SAR, a bit over again due to that midweek restaurant meal and some extra fruit/snacks. Visually, I'm noticing more shoulder definition and my pants fit looser around the waist, so recomp is progressing. Recovery felt okay but not optimal—those two short sleep nights and elevated calories threw me off rhythm. Sunday I prioritized rest and meal prep to reset for next week. Overall, 4/4 workouts done, adherence ~70%, and I'm seeing results despite the hiccups."
P09,2026-W04,16.15,29.85,71.1,2517,6.8,"Week 4 brought a mixed bag of progress and challenges. Started strong with solid meal prep and hit all four scheduled workouts (W25, W21, W25, W21), which felt great for consistency. The upper body sessions on Tuesday and Friday were solid—felt stronger on overhead press and noticed better shoulder pump. Lower body days (Monday and Thursday) were tougher; Monday's volume was high and DOMS hit hard by Tuesday evening, making Wednesday's movement stiff. Thursday's session I had to dial back the back squat intensity slightly due to lingering fatigue and subpar sleep.

Calorie adherence was decent but not perfect. Hit target on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday. Wednesday I grabbed shawarma with colleagues after a late work session—came in around 2,640 kcal, about 150 over target. Saturday was a family gathering with a big dinner, pushed me to roughly 2,610 kcal. The other days I stayed disciplined, and protein averaged around 154g daily, so I'm happy with that.

Sleep was the biggest struggle this week. Wednesday and Thursday nights I only got about 6.3 and 6.5 hours respectively due to a work deadline and evening social commitment. Felt it in my recovery and energy—Friday's workout was noticeably harder, and I had to reduce squat load by about 5kg to maintain form. The other nights averaged closer to 7 hours, which helped.

Budget-wise, I went slightly over at around 375 SAR for the week (about 25 SAR above my 350 target). The Wednesday shawarma meal and some extra groceries for weekend meal prep pushed it up. Not terrible, but need to watch restaurant meals.

Positives: I'm seeing visual changes—shoulders look more defined, and my waist feels tighter (maybe down 0.5cm, hard to measure precisely). Strength is holding or slightly improving on upper body lifts. Recovery was manageable despite the sleep hiccups, and I stayed hydrated well post-workout.

Challenges: Sleep debt accumulated mid-week impacted performance and hunger cues. Social and work commitments pulled me off track twice for meals. DOMS from Monday's lower session was more intense than usual, possibly due to the volume and fatigue accumulation.

Overall, I'd rate this week a 7/10. Workouts all completed, recomp progress visible, but sleep and meal discipline need tightening. Going into next week, I'll prioritize earlier bedtimes and prep grab-and-go meals for busy days."
P09,2026-W05,15.95,29.95,70.95,2537,6.79,"Week 5 of 2026 is complete. This was a solid week overall, though I hit some familiar bumps. Started Monday strong with lower body workout W25—felt powerful on squats and Romanian deadlifts, though DOMS hit hard Tuesday morning as expected. Meal prep on Sunday paid off; I had chicken, rice, and roasted vegetables ready to go for the first three days, which kept me on track nutritionally.

Tuesday's upper body session (W21) went well—bench press felt strong, and I'm seeing better shoulder definition in the mirror. However, Wednesday was rough. Work deadline stress meant I stayed up late, only got about 6.2 hours of sleep, and ended up grabbing a shawarma wrap for lunch instead of my prepped meal. Calorie count went over by about 150 kcal that day, but protein was still decent at around 160g.

Thursday I was dragging from the sleep debt—managed only 6.5 hours again. Still hit the gym for my second W25 lower body session, but had to drop weight slightly on leg press and lunges. My legs were still somewhat sore from Monday, and fatigue was real. Recovery felt slower than usual.

Friday's upper body (W21) was better after catching up on sleep Thursday night (got a solid 7.2 hours). Overhead press felt good, and pull-ups are getting easier—I'm up to 3 sets of 8 reps now. Saturday I went slightly over on calories again (about 120 kcal) due to a social dinner, but I made smart choices—grilled fish and salad, just a bit more rice than planned.

Sunday was a rest day, and I used it to meal prep again, though I wasn't as thorough as the previous week. Budget-wise, I came in around 375 SAR for the week—about 25 SAR over my target of 350. The extra spending was mainly from that Wednesday shawarma and some additional protein powder I picked up mid-week.

Physically, I'm noticing positive changes. My waist feels tighter when I put on my work pants, and my shoulders look more defined, especially the delts. The scale hasn't moved much, which is expected for recomp, but the mirror tells a better story. Weight is stable around 71 kg, maybe down 0.1-0.2 kg, but I think I'm gaining a bit of muscle while losing a small amount of fat.

The main challenges remain sleep and mid-week discipline. When work gets hectic, my sleep suffers, and that cascades into food choices and gym performance. I need to be more protective of my sleep schedule, especially Wednesday and Thursday nights. On the positive side, my adherence propensity of 0.72 feels accurate—I hit 5 out of 7 days perfectly on nutrition, completed all 4 scheduled workouts, and stayed mostly within budget.

Protein intake averaged 154g daily, right on target. Hydration was good throughout—I've been consistent with my 2.5-3 liters daily. No injuries, no significant soreness beyond normal DOMS. Recovery is adequate but definitely impacted by those two short sleep nights.

Looking ahead, I want to focus on protecting my mid-week sleep better and maybe simplifying my Wednesday meal prep so I'm less tempted to grab convenience food when stressed. Overall, though, this feels sustainable, and I'm seeing the recomp results I'm after. Strength is maintained or slightly improving on upper body, and once I get more consistent sleep, I think lower body will catch up too."
P09,2026-W06,15.72,30.08,70.88,2408,6.85,"Week 6 of 2026 was a solid continuation of my recomp journey, though I faced some familiar mid-week challenges. Started strong on Monday with W25 (upper body) - felt powerful on the bench press and managed to push through all sets with good form. Tuesday's nutrition was spot-on, hit my macros perfectly with the meal prep I'd done Sunday evening. Wednesday brought the usual work stress spike, and I could feel the sleep debt catching up (only got 6.1 hours). Ended up grabbing a chicken shawarma wrap at lunch which pushed me about 180 kcal over target, but I adjusted dinner to minimize damage. Thursday's W21 (lower body) session was tough - legs still had some residual soreness from Monday, and the fatigue was real. Had to drop the weight slightly on back squats by about 5kg to maintain proper depth and form. Friday was a rest day that I desperately needed. Sleep improved to 7.2 hours and I felt much more recovered. Saturday's W25 session was excellent - energy levels were back up and I hit some solid numbers on overhead press. The evening social dinner with friends at a Turkish restaurant put me about 140 kcal over, but I made conscious choices (grilled meats, skipped the bread basket mostly). Sunday's W21 workout felt strong, particularly on deadlifts where form felt locked in. Overall, I'm noticing continued shoulder and chest definition, and my waist measurement seems to be trending down slightly. The scale hasn't moved much, which is exactly what I want for recomp. Protein averaged around 151g/day, just slightly above my 146g target. Budget came in at 362 SAR for the week, staying under my 350 SAR target this time by being more strategic with protein sources (bought chicken thighs on sale, used more eggs). Recovery is the ongoing challenge - I really need to prioritize that 7+ hour sleep target, especially mid-week. The adherence propensity held up well despite the obstacles."
P09,2026-W07,15.48,30.19,70.65,2473,6.8,"Week 7 felt like a solid continuation of my recomp journey, though I hit some real-world bumps that tested my consistency. Started strong Monday with W25 upper body - felt powerful on bench press and shoulder work, hitting all my sets cleanly. Nutrition was on point that day at 2410 kcal with 156g protein. Tuesday I kept calories tight at 2380 kcal, though sleep took a hit at 6.3 hours due to work deadline stress.

Wednesday was my first stumble - combination of poor sleep carryover and a client lunch pushed me to 2680 kcal, about 230 over target. I made decent protein choices (grilled chicken at lunch) but the sides and a dessert I couldn't refuse added up. Felt slightly bloated that evening but reminded myself one day doesn't derail progress.

Thursday's W21 lower body session was tough. Legs still had residual fatigue, and my 6.2-hour sleep night didn't help. I completed all sets but had to drop back squat working weight by 3kg from my last W21 session - listening to my body rather than ego-lifting. Nutrition recovered well at 2420 kcal with solid 149g protein.

Friday was a rest day where I focused on recovery - hit 7.4 hours sleep (finally!), kept calories at 2395 kcal, and did 15 minutes of light stretching. Felt significantly better. Saturday's W25 upper session showed the recovery paid off - matched my Monday performance and even added 2.5kg to my overhead press for the final set. Post-workout I had a family gathering which pushed me to 2590 kcal (about 140 over), but I made strategic choices: extra protein from grilled meats, limited the rice, skipped sugary drinks.

Sunday's W21 lower body was redemptive - back to full working weights on squats, nailed my deadlift sets with good form. Sleep Saturday night was excellent at 7.6 hours. Closed the week at 2440 kcal with 158g protein.

Overall adherence: 4/7 days hit calorie target exactly, 2 days moderately over (social situations), 1 day significantly over. All 4 scheduled workouts completed with good intensity despite mid-week fatigue. Protein averaged 152g daily (above my 146g target). Sleep averaged 6.8 hours - slightly below my recent 6.85h average, with mid-week dip being the culprit.

Budget came in at 356 SAR for the week (6 SAR under my 350 SAR target when accounting for 2 SAR daily buffer). The Wednesday client lunch was covered by work, which helped offset the Saturday family gathering ingredients I contributed.

Physically, I'm noticing continued shoulder cap development and my upper chest is filling out nicely. Took progress photos Sunday morning and compared to 3 weeks ago - definite visible fat loss around lower abs while maintaining fullness in arms and shoulders. Weight is holding relatively stable which is exactly what I want for recomp. DOMS was moderate after both upper sessions, more pronounced after Thursday's lower (likely due to the fatigue), but manageable after Sunday's session.

The mental game remains strong. Even with Wednesday's overage, I didn't spiral into 'screw it' mentality. That's growth. Mid-week stress management is still my biggest barrier - when work pressure hits, sleep suffers, then decision-making around food gets harder. I'm considering implementing a 10-minute evening wind-down routine before bed on work nights.

Hydration stayed consistent at 2.7-3.0L daily. No injuries or concerning aches. Energy levels were variable - excellent on high-sleep days, noticeably dragging Wednesday/Thursday. Looking ahead, I want to protect those mid-week sleep hours better and maybe prep an extra emergency meal option for stressful days to avoid decision fatigue around food."
P09,2026-W08,15.31,30.28,70.55,2389,6.9,"Week 8 felt like a solid continuation of my recomp journey, though I'm noticing the cumulative fatigue from maintaining this pace. Started the week strong with Monday's W25 upper session - the progressive overload is really showing now, especially in my pressing movements. I hit all four workouts as planned (W25 Mon, W21 Thu, W25 Sat, W21 Sun), which I'm proud of given the mid-week work crunch.

Calorie adherence was decent at 5/7 days on target. Tuesday I went over by about 180 kcal at a team dinner (work-covered, so budget unaffected), and Friday I was under by roughly 120 kcal due to back-to-back meetings killing my appetite. The other days I nailed the 2395 kcal target pretty well. Protein averaged around 148g/day, just slightly under my 150g target but close enough that I'm not concerned.

Sleep was the struggle this week. Monday through Wednesday I averaged only 6.4 hours due to a major project deadline. Thursday and Friday improved to 6.9h each, and I caught up over the weekend with 7.5h Saturday and 7.3h Sunday. Weekly average came to 6.9h - a marginal improvement from last week's 6.8h, but still not ideal. I can feel it in my recovery; the DOMS from Thursday's lower body session lingered until Saturday.

Thursday's W21 lower workout was tough. My back squat felt heavy, and I had to drop the working weight by 2kg compared to last week. I think it was the sleep debt catching up. By Sunday's repeat W21 session, I'd recovered and matched my previous numbers, so no real strength loss, just fatigue management.

Saturday's W25 upper was excellent - added 2.5kg to my overhead press and the movement felt smooth. Chest and shoulders are visibly fuller in the mirror, and I'm starting to see more separation in my lower abs, especially in morning light. The recomp is definitely working.

Budget came in at 348 SAR for the week, well under my 350 SAR target (50 SAR/day × 7). The Tuesday dinner being covered helped, and I've gotten better at meal prepping Sunday and Wednesday to avoid impulse purchases. Hydration stayed consistent at 2.8-3.1L daily.

Mental game is strong. Even when I went over calories Tuesday, I didn't spiral - just adjusted Wednesday's breakfast slightly and moved on. That's a big win for me. The mid-week stress is still my primary barrier, but I'm learning to manage it without derailing my nutrition or skipping workouts.

Overall, I feel like I'm in a good rhythm. The visual changes are motivating, strength is progressing (even if not linearly every week), and I'm staying within budget. Next week I need to prioritize sleep more aggressively - maybe front-load some work tasks to avoid the Wednesday/Thursday crunch. Body composition is heading in the right direction, and I'm confident in the process."
P09,2026-W09,15.18,30.35,70.48,2371,6.9,"Week 9 of 2026 wrapped up solidly despite some familiar mid-week turbulence. Monday kicked off with W25 upper body—felt strong, maintained the OHP progression from last week's +2.5kg bump. Energy was good early week, though I could feel the sleep debt creeping in by Tuesday. That evening team dinner pushed me about +165 kcal over target, but I kept it reasonable and didn't let it derail Wednesday. Wednesday was a pure grind—project deadline stress hit hard, sleep was only 6.2 hours, and I felt foggy all day. Managed to stay on calorie target but had to force-feed the evening protein.

Thursday's W21 lower session was tough. Legs felt heavy from accumulated fatigue, and I had to drop back squat weight by about 2kg to maintain form. No shame in that—listening to my body is part of the process. DOMS hit moderately by Friday morning, but manageable. Friday I actually undershot calories by about -95 kcal due to back-to-back meetings killing my appetite, but hit protein at 151g so not concerned.

Weekend was the recovery window I needed. Sleep bumped to 7.4h Saturday and 7.2h Sunday, which made a massive difference. Saturday's W25 upper felt rejuvenating—shoulder pump was excellent, and I'm seeing continued definition in the lateral delts and upper chest. Sunday's W21 lower was redemptive; fully recovered strength, hit all working sets at planned weight, felt explosive on the leg press. Lower abs are definitely more visible now, especially in morning light. The recomp is real.

Budget came in at 346 SAR for the week—4 SAR under target, which feels like a small win given I'm not sacrificing food quality. Protein averaged 150g across the week (right on target), and I'm getting better at meal prep efficiency. Hydration stayed consistent at 2.9-3.2L daily. The mental game remains strong; I'm not spiraling when life throws curveballs, just adjusting and moving forward.

Barriers this week were the usual suspects: mid-week sleep debt (Mon-Wed averaged 6.3h) and work stress. But I completed all 4 scheduled workouts without skips, and adherence was 6/7 days within reasonable calorie range. The one overage and one underage basically canceled out. Visually, I'm noticing shoulder width increasing and waist staying tight. No injuries, no joint issues. DOMS resolved quickly, which suggests recovery is adequate despite imperfect sleep.

Looking ahead, I want to protect that mid-week sleep better—maybe push back one evening task to create space. But overall, this week reinforced that consistency trumps perfection. The trajectory is positive, strength is climbing or stable, and body composition is visibly improving. Feeling confident and motivated going into next week."

The workouts were solid; the advanced upper body and legs sessions at the gym felt challenging but manageable given my intermediate fitness level. I pushed hard on compound movements and noticed good muscle engagement. Sleep remained consistent around my usual 6.9 hours, though I could probably benefit from more rest given the training intensity. Energy levels dipped slightly mid-week, likely due to the caloric deficit, but recovered toward the weekend. The recomposition goal seems achievable if I can dial in the nutrition more precisely."

The shakshuka breakfast was satisfying, and I enjoyed the lamb kebabs, but the overall calorie target seems dangerously low for my activity level and goals. Energy levels dipped noticeably mid-week, affecting my advanced gym sessions - I had to reduce weights by about 10% on upper body day. Sleep remained poor at around 5.5 hours due to work stress and some hunger-related restlessness. I did notice some definition improvement, likely from the severe deficit combined with high protein relative to calories. However, this feels unsustainable long-term. I'm concerned about muscle loss if I continue at this calorie level."

I felt constantly fatigued, lightheaded, and struggled to complete my workouts with proper intensity. My adherence was around 72%, but honestly, I had to add extra food on workout days just to avoid passing out. I managed about 900-1000 kcal most days instead of 640. The meals themselves were tasty and well-balanced in macros, but the total volume is simply insufficient. My sleep suffered even more than usual due to hunger pangs. I'm concerned about the sustainability and safety of this plan - at 4.2% body fat, I'm already extremely lean and this severe deficit is counterproductive for recomposition. I need significantly more calories to support muscle maintenance and growth."

I averaged closer to 1100-1200 kcal/day instead of 640, which still left me exhausted. The workouts suffered - I couldn't lift my usual weights and had to cut some sets short. Sleep remained poor at around 5 hours due to hunger and low energy. The meals themselves were good quality when I made them, but the portions were tiny. I'm concerned this plan is unsafe and unsustainable. I did lose some weight, mostly water and glycogen from the severe deficit, but I also feel weaker. My body fat was already critically low at 4% - going lower is dangerous."
P09,2026-W43,3.3,31.5,58.2,755,5,"The first week was challenging but manageable. With 72% adherence, I followed the meal plan about 5 out of 7 days pretty closely. The 640 kcal target felt extremely low for my activity level and I experienced significant hunger, especially on workout days. I ended up adding small portions of nuts or an extra pita on 2 days when the hunger became unbearable. The foul medames and mujadara were filling and easy to prepare with my intermediate cooking skills. The advanced gym workouts were intense - I completed all 4 sessions but felt depleted during the upper body day due to low energy. Sleep remained poor at around 5 hours, partly due to hunger waking me up. I noticed feeling lighter and leaner, but also weaker on some lifts. The extreme caloric deficit is not sustainable long-term, but I did see visible changes in the mirror. I'm concerned about muscle loss given the low protein and calories combined with advanced training."

I stuck to the plan about 72% of the time, but honestly had to add some extra protein shakes post-workout to avoid feeling completely depleted during my gym sessions. The shakshuka breakfast was great, and I enjoyed the kabsa, but by day 3-4 I was experiencing significant hunger and low energy. Sleep remained poor at around 5 hours - the calorie deficit and hunger made it hard to fall asleep some nights. The advanced upper body and leg workouts were tough on this intake; I managed them but had to reduce volume slightly on days 5-6. I did notice some definition coming through, likely from the severe deficit and water loss, but I'm concerned this isn't sustainable long-term."

My sleep remained poor at around 5 hours due to hunger and existing sleep issues. The workouts were tough to complete with this energy deficit - I had to reduce weights by about 15% on upper body day and struggled through legs. I did lose some weight, but I'm concerned this is too aggressive. At 3.1% body fat, I'm already extremely lean and this severe deficit is not sustainable or healthy for recomposition.

I had to add some extra protein shakes and snacks on workout days just to have energy to complete the sessions. The shakshuka breakfast was great and filling, and I enjoyed the grilled fish dinners. However, the lentil soup alone wasn't enough for lunch on heavy training days. Sleep remained poor at around 5 hours due to work stress, which definitely impacted my recovery. The upper body and leg workouts were intense and appropriate for my intermediate-to-advanced level. I felt stronger by the end of the week but also quite fatigued. My adherence dropped a bit mid-week when hunger and low energy hit hardest. I probably averaged closer to 900-1000 kcal daily when accounting for the extra food I needed.

The meals themselves were tasty and I could prepare them fine with my intermediate cooking skills, but the portions were far too small.

P10,2025-W46,30.2,24.2,73.1,1320,6.8,"This week was challenging but I managed to stick with it more days than not. The ful medames breakfast was filling and I actually enjoyed it, though by day 4 I was craving variety. The kabsa for lunch was delicious but took longer to prepare than I expected with my beginner cooking skills - I ended up simplifying the spices. I skipped the labneh meal twice this week when I got home late and just had the laban with dates instead. The workouts were honestly too advanced for my beginner level - I had to modify most exercises and couldn't complete all the sets. My legs were so sore after the first leg day that I almost skipped the second workout. I did make it to the gym 2 out of 3 planned days though, which I'm proud of. Sleep was decent most nights around 7 hours, but I had two nights where I only got about 6 hours due to work stress. I'm seeing the scale move down slightly which is motivating, but I'm exhausted and not sure these advanced workouts are right for me yet."
P10,2025-W47,29.9,24.1,72.6,1875,6.8,"Week 2 complete! This week was definitely tougher than I expected. I started off motivated on Monday, but by Wednesday I was already feeling the fatigue from only getting about 6-7 hours of sleep. The meal prep took WAY longer than I thought - I'm still getting used to cooking from scratch and some of the recipes were confusing. I ended up simplifying a lot of meals or just making quick protein shakes when I ran out of time.

Workout-wise, I managed to do 2 out of the 3 planned sessions. W33 on Monday went okay but I had to take longer breaks between sets. I skipped W29 on Wednesday because I stayed late at work and was just exhausted. Made it to W21 on Saturday morning which felt good, though I modified some of the exercises to make them easier. My knees were bothering me during lunges so I did step-ups instead.

Food adherence was around 55-60% I'd say. I hit my protein targets maybe 4 out of 7 days. The other days I was probably 300-400 calories under because I either forgot to eat a snack or didn't have time to prep properly. Budget was fine - stayed within my 30 SAR/day limit by buying in bulk and keeping meals simple. 

I'm feeling a bit discouraged because I don't see much change on the scale yet, but I know it's only been two weeks total. My clothes might be fitting slightly better? Hard to tell. The lack of sleep is definitely my biggest barrier - I need to work on getting to bed earlier but with my schedule it's tough. Overall, I'm proud I stuck with it even if it wasn't perfect. Next week I'll try to prep on Sunday so weekdays are easier."
P10,2025-W48,29.7,24,72.2,1985,6.8,"Completed my week 48 simulation and honestly, it was a mixed bag. Started with good intentions on Monday, prepped some basics like grilled chicken and rice, but by Wednesday I was already feeling the time crunch. Work got hectic and I skipped my mid-morning snacks on Tuesday and Thursday - just grabbed coffee instead. The 2230 calorie target felt high at first, but I realized I was undereating on the days I simplified meals, probably hitting around 1800-1900 kcal those days.

Workouts were tough. Managed W33 on Monday which was doable, and W29 on Thursday with some modifications - I had to skip the jump movements because of my knee acting up again. Completely missed the Friday workout (W21) because I stayed late at work and just didn't have the energy. By the time I got home, I just wanted to crash.

Sleep was all over the place. Got a solid 7.5 hours on Sunday night which helped Monday feel strong, but Tuesday through Thursday I was back to my usual 6-6.5 hours. Friday I only managed 6 hours and felt it hard on Saturday. Weekend sleep was better at around 7 hours each night.

Budget-wise, I stayed under 30 SAR/day pretty easily. Stuck to basics - chicken, rice, eggs, frozen veggies, bananas, and oats. My beginner cooking skills meant everything was pretty plain, but it worked. I did grab a shawarma on Wednesday when I was too tired to cook, but it was only 15 SAR so still within budget.

Energy levels were definitely low mid-week. I think it's the combination of not enough sleep and maybe not hitting my protein targets consistently. I noticed I felt better on the days I actually ate the planned snacks. The meal prep time is still my biggest barrier - spending an hour on Sunday helps, but I need to do more.

Physically, I feel slightly lighter, maybe a bit less bloated. My clothes fit about the same. The scale showed a small drop but I'm trying not to obsess over daily fluctuations. My knee is still a concern - I need to keep modifying high-impact stuff. Overall adherence was probably around 60% this week, which matches my usual pattern."
P10,2025-W49,29.3,24.1,71.8,2180,7,"Week 49 was challenging but I managed slightly better than last week. Started Monday strong with meal prep on Sunday evening - made overnight oats and prepped chicken breasts which really helped. Completed W33 on Monday feeling good, though my knee was a bit tender afterward so I iced it. Tuesday I was exhausted from only 6 hours sleep and skipped my planned snack, ended up grabbing a shawarma wrap for dinner (budget-friendly at least). Wednesday hit W29 with modifications again - substituted jumping movements with step-backs. Energy was better mid-week this time because I prioritized 7+ hours sleep Tuesday and Wednesday nights. Thursday and Friday my diet adherence dropped - meal prep ran out and I simplified to eggs, toast, and whatever protein I could grab quickly. Friday evening I was too tired for W21 after a long work day, plus my knee was acting up again. Weekend was mixed - Saturday I ate out with friends (budget stretched to 35 SAR that day) but made reasonable choices, Sunday I did a light walk instead of the missed workout and prepped some food again. Overall hit about 65% adherence this week - 2 of 3 workouts completed, 4.5 days of solid nutrition. The sleep improvement mid-week made a noticeable difference in my energy and decision-making. Protein was better on prep days but still inconsistent. My knee needs attention - might need to see someone about it."
P10,2025-W50,29.1,24.1,71.5,2095,7,"Week 50 was a mixed bag - I started strong but life got in the way toward the end. Sunday meal prep really helped the first few days, and I managed to stick pretty close to my macros Monday through Wednesday. Completed W33 on Monday feeling energized after decent sleep, though my knee was tender during lunges so I kept the range of motion conservative. Wednesday's W29 workout went well - the bodyweight exercises felt manageable and I'm getting better at the modified planks.

Thursday is where things started slipping. Work got incredibly hectic with year-end deadlines, and I ended up staying late two nights in a row. My sleep dropped to about 6 hours Thursday and Friday, which killed my energy. I skipped the W21 workout on Friday because I was just exhausted and my knee was acting up again - I did try to take a 20-minute walk during lunch but that was it. 

Diet-wise, I did okay until Friday when I grabbed takeout shawarma (probably 35 SAR and way over my sodium limit). Saturday I tried to get back on track but only hit about 70% of my protein target because I ran out of prepped chicken and didn't have energy to cook. Sunday was better - did another meal prep session which always helps me feel more in control.

The frustrating part is I can feel the difference when I sleep well versus when I don't. Tuesday and Wednesday I had 7.5 hours and felt like a different person - workouts were easier, I made better food choices, and I had energy for the day. But those late work nights just derailed everything. My knee is still a concern - it's not getting worse but it's not really improving either. I'm icing it and doing the stretches my friend recommended.

Budget was mostly on track except for that Friday takeout day. I averaged around 30 SAR daily when I factor in the whole week. I need to prep some easy backup meals for those crazy work days so I'm not tempted by expensive takeout. Overall adherence was probably around 60% this week - not terrible given the circumstances, but I know I can do better when work calms down after the holidays."
P10,2025-W51,28.95,24.15,71.3,2180,7,"Week 51 was a mixed bag for me. Started strong with Sunday meal prep which really helped Monday through Wednesday - I stuck to my calorie targets and felt energized. Hit my Tuesday and Thursday workouts (W33 and W29) without issues, though I had to modify some movements due to my ongoing knee discomfort. Wednesday evening I felt a dip in energy from accumulated work stress, and by Thursday night I was craving comfort food. Friday was rough - work ran late, I only got 6.5 hours of sleep, and I ended up ordering takeout (chicken shawarma plate) that pushed me about 400 calories over target and way over on sodium. I could feel the water retention by Saturday morning. I completely missed my Saturday W21 workout because I was just exhausted and my knee was achy. Did manage a 30-minute walk instead. Weekend diet adherence dropped to maybe 50% - had some unplanned snacking Saturday afternoon. Sunday I rallied and did my meal prep again, which felt like getting back on track. My weight fluctuated quite a bit day-to-day, mostly water weight from the high-sodium Friday and inconsistent hydration. Overall, I'd say I hit about 60% adherence on diet and 67% on workouts (2 out of 3). The pattern is clear - when I'm rested and have prepped meals, I do well. When work stress hits and sleep suffers, everything falls apart. Need to find better stress management strategies and maybe have some healthy backup options for those crazy work days."
P10,2025-W52,28.75,24.2,71.1,2245,7,"Week 52 was a mixed bag for me. I started strong with meal prep from Sunday carrying into Monday and Tuesday, hitting my calorie and protein targets pretty well. The workouts felt manageable - W33 on Tuesday went smoothly, and I'm getting better at the modified movements for my knee. By Wednesday though, I could feel my motivation slipping. Work stress picked up and I found myself reaching for convenient options instead of my prepped meals.

Thursday's W29 workout was tough - I was already feeling a bit fatigued and my knee was giving me some twinges, but I pushed through with modifications. Friday was my downfall again - ordered chicken mandi with extra rice because I was too tired to cook, and that definitely blew past my budget and calorie target. I could feel the bloating by Saturday morning from all that sodium.

I attempted W21 on Saturday but my knee was really uncomfortable and I felt heavy from Friday's meal, so I swapped it for a 40-minute walk instead. Better than nothing, right? Saturday afternoon I stress-snacked on some dates and Arabic coffee with a friend, which added extra calories I hadn't planned for.

Sunday I got back on track with meal prep - made grilled chicken, brown rice, and roasted vegetables for the week ahead. I feel like I'm in this cycle of doing well for 3-4 days, then falling off for 2-3 days. My adherence was probably around 55-60% this week, slightly below my usual pattern. The knee issue is frustrating because I want to push harder but I know I need to be careful.

Positive note: I did drink more water this week after seeing how puffy I got from the high-sodium meal. My sleep stayed consistent around 7 hours, though I wish I could get more. The scale isn't moving as fast as I'd like, but I can feel slight changes in how my clothes fit around my waist."
P10,2026-W01,28.65,24.25,71,2180,7,"Week 1 of 2026 was a mixed bag. Started strong with good meal prep momentum from Sunday, but hit familiar patterns mid-week. The 30 SAR daily budget is tight but manageable when I plan ahead. My knee felt better this week with the modifications, which was a relief. I managed all three workouts this time (W33 Monday, W29 Wednesday, W21 Friday), though Friday's session was shorter than planned. Diet adherence was around 60% - solid Monday through Wednesday morning, then slipped Thursday evening when I grabbed shawarma after a long day at work. Friday I stayed on track until evening social plans derailed me. Weekend was better than last week - no major takeout splurges. The 2068 kcal target feels reasonable but I'm definitely hungry some evenings, especially after workout days. Sleep was consistent at 7 hours most nights except Saturday when I stayed up late. Water intake was good early week but I forgot my bottle Thursday and Friday. Overall, I'd say this was a maintenance week - didn't lose ground but didn't make huge progress either. The beginner workouts are getting slightly easier which is encouraging."
P10,2026-W02,28.4,24.35,70.7,2140,7,"Week 2 (2026-W02) complete! Started strong with Sunday meal prep carrying over, which really helped Monday and Tuesday adherence. Managed all 3 workouts again - W33 on Monday felt easier than last week, knee modifications are becoming second nature. W29 Wednesday was challenging but I pushed through the full 40 minutes. W21 Friday was solid, didn't need to cut it short this time which felt like a win. 

Diet-wise, breakfast and lunch were consistently good throughout the week thanks to having prepped containers ready. The grilled chicken and brown rice combo is getting a bit repetitive but it's working. Wednesday dinner I had a moment of weakness and ordered a small chicken shawarma plate (about 480 kcal, 18 SAR) but kept it smaller than last week's wrap. Thursday I stayed on track which was an improvement from Week 1. 

Friday evening was tricky - colleague's birthday at work meant cake and snacks. I had a small slice (estimated ~250 kcal) but skipped the Arabic coffee and extra pastries, so better control than last Friday's social event. Saturday I felt a bit sluggish, maybe from the week catching up, so I did a longer meal prep session and made extra vegetables to mix things up.

Sleep was pretty consistent around 7 hours except Wednesday night (6.5 hours - work stress) and Saturday night (7.5 hours - caught up). Water intake improved overall, averaged 2.2L daily except Friday (1.8L - busy day). 

Knee feels good, no real discomfort. I'm noticing my plank holds are getting slightly longer and squats feel more stable. Weight stayed relatively stable with minor fluctuations. The bloating from last week's sodium didn't repeat. Budget was better - only exceeded by about 8 SAR total (that Wednesday shawarma). 

Feeling more confident in the routine now. The consistency is building and I can feel small improvements in strength and endurance. Week 3 goal: try to add more variety to meals without breaking budget, and maybe push a bit harder in the workouts since modifications are feeling comfortable."
P10,2026-W03,28.2,24.45,70.5,2245,7,"Week 3 felt like a turning point for me! I managed to complete all 3 planned workouts again, which is really building my confidence. Monday's W33 was 35 minutes and my knee felt great throughout - those modifications are really working. Wednesday's W29 pushed me hard for 40 minutes, but I powered through even though I was tired from work stress. Friday's W21 was a solid 30-minute session and I felt strong.

Diet-wise, I'm proud of myself for staying more consistent this week. My meal prep game is getting better - I made a big batch on Sunday that lasted through Wednesday. I did slip up on Thursday with a restaurant lunch (chicken biryani that was probably 650 kcal and cost 22 SAR), which put me over budget that day. Friday I grabbed a quick shawarma wrap (380 kcal/15 SAR) because I was rushing between meetings. Saturday I had a family gathering and definitely overindulged on kabsa and desserts - probably hit 2600 kcal that day, but I'm trying not to beat myself up about it.

The positive: I prepped again on Sunday and I'm noticing my portions are more controlled now. I can actually feel myself getting fuller faster. My planks are holding longer and my squats feel more stable. Sleep was decent this week, averaging around 7 hours, though Tuesday night I only got 6 hours because of work deadlines.

The challenging: Meal prep variety is becoming an issue - I'm getting tired of the same chicken and rice combinations. I need to find new beginner-friendly recipes that fit my budget. Also, I'm noticing I'm hungrier on workout days and sometimes go over my calorie target by 100-150 kcal. Water intake was good most days (2.3L average) except Saturday when I only managed 1.5L at the family event.

Weight seems stable with small fluctuations - I think I'm seeing very slight changes in how my clothes fit around my waist, which is encouraging even if the scale isn't moving much. My knee continues to feel good with the modifications. Overall adherence this week was around 65% - better than last week's 62%!"
P10,2026-W04,27.9,24.55,70.1,2268,6.9,"Week 4 was a mixed bag with some real wins and a couple of challenging days. Started strong with meal prep on Sunday - made my usual chicken and rice bowls plus tried a new lentil soup recipe which helped with the variety fatigue I mentioned last week. Monday's W33 workout felt great, my knee is completely comfortable now and I'm noticing I can hold planks for almost 45 seconds without shaking!

Tuesday was tough - work deadline had me staying late and I only got 6 hours of sleep. Ended up grabbing a shawarma on the way home (340 kcal, 14 SAR) because I was too tired to cook. Wednesday's W29 workout was harder than usual, probably because I was still tired, but I pushed through and completed it. Felt proud of that.

Thursday I was invited to a colleague's birthday lunch and had kunafa for dessert - totally worth it but put me over budget and calories. Friday's W21 workout was solid, felt energized. Weekend was better controlled than last week's family gathering - I planned ahead and ate lighter before Saturday's dinner party, so even though I indulged, I kept it around 2400 kcal instead of 2600+.

The lentil soup was a game-changer for variety, and I'm getting faster at meal prep (down to 2 hours from 2.5). My work pants are definitely looser around the waist - I had to tighten my belt one notch! Hunger on workout days is still an issue, I'm adding an extra 100 kcal snack (Greek yogurt) on those days which seems to help. Water intake was consistent except Saturday (1.8L). Budget went over by 9 SAR total this week due to the Tuesday shawarma and Thursday lunch outing."
P10,2026-W05,27.4,24.7,69.7,2275,6.9,"Week 5 is complete! This was a challenging week with some ups and downs. I managed all 3 workouts again which I'm proud of, especially since work was hectic mid-week. The new meal prep routine is definitely helping - I'm getting faster at it and the lentil soup from last week became a staple this week too. 

Monday's W33 workout felt strong, my plank holds are consistently hitting 45-50 seconds now which is amazing progress from where I started. Wednesday's W29 session was tough - I only got 6.5 hours of sleep Tuesday night due to a project deadline, and I could feel the fatigue during squats. Friday's W21 was much better, good energy and form throughout.

Diet-wise, I had a couple of slips but managed better than Week 4. Tuesday I grabbed a quick shawarma wrap again (seems to be my weakness when tired!), about 380 kcal and 15 SAR. Thursday I had a work lunch that went over budget by about 200 kcal. The weekend was better controlled - I planned ahead for Saturday's family gathering and ate lighter during the day, so my evening meal didn't blow the budget as badly as previous weeks.

Sleep averaged 6.9 hours again, which is consistent but I know I need to push for 7+ hours. The nights I got 7.5 hours I felt so much better during workouts. Water intake was good at 2.3L average, except Sunday when I only managed 1.9L.

The scale is showing slow progress but my clothes continue to fit better. I can definitely see more definition in my legs and my core feels stronger. The belt is staying at that one notch tighter position comfortably now. My knee continues to feel great - no issues at all.

Budget was 12 SAR over for the week due to the Tuesday shawarma and Thursday lunch, but I'm learning to plan better. Next week I'll prep some grab-and-go options for those tired days. Overall adherence felt like about 60% - I hit my workouts but diet consistency could be better. Still, I'm seeing progress and that keeps me motivated!"
P10,2026-W06,27.1,24.8,69.4,2245,6.85,"Week 6 felt like a consolidation week - I maintained the momentum from Week 5 but didn't quite break through to the next level. The good news: I hit all three workouts and they felt strong, especially the Friday session where everything just clicked. My plank holds are now consistently 50-55 seconds, which feels amazing compared to where I started. The meal prep on Sunday took me only 1.75 hours - I'm getting faster and more efficient with my recipes.

The challenges this week were mostly around sleep and Tuesday again (noticing a pattern here). Monday night I only got 6.3 hours due to a work presentation prep, and that affected my Tuesday energy levels. I managed to avoid the shawarma slip this time by having a pre-packed lunch ready, but I definitely felt the fatigue. Wednesday's workout was solid despite the tiredness. Thursday I finally got a good 7.4 hours of sleep and felt like a new person - the difference is so noticeable.

Saturday was tricky with a friend's birthday dinner. I planned ahead by eating lighter during the day (around 1650 calories total for breakfast and lunch), which gave me room to enjoy the dinner without going overboard. I estimate I ate around 2400 calories for the day, but it was controlled compared to previous social events. I'm learning to navigate these situations better.

The scale moved down slightly this week - only 0.3kg, but my measurements tell a better story. My waist feels even looser in my pants, and I can see more definition in my legs and shoulders. The mirror progress is more motivating than the scale right now. My knee continues to feel great with zero discomfort.

Budget-wise, I stayed within limits this week (only 8 SAR over across the whole week), which feels like a win. The Greek yogurt snacks on workout days continue to be essential - they cost a bit extra but prevent me from making worse choices later.

Looking ahead, I need to prioritize sleep more consistently. The 7+ hour nights make such a difference in my energy, food choices, and workout performance. I'm also going to prep some Tuesday-specific grab-and-go options since that seems to be my vulnerable day."
P10,2026-W07,26.8,24.9,69.2,2189,6.65,"Week 7 started with good momentum from last week's improvements, but hit some turbulence mid-week. Monday's workout (W33) felt surprisingly strong despite Sunday meal prep fatigue - plank holds hit 53-54 seconds consistently, and I'm really noticing the shoulder definition when I catch my reflection. The diet adherence Tuesday was excellent again - that pre-packed lunch strategy is becoming second nature now, and I actually craved the healthy option over shawarma. Wednesday's recovery workout (W29) was solid, though I could feel the accumulated fatigue from poor sleep Monday and Tuesday (6.4h both nights due to work deadline stress).

Thursday is where things got challenging. Unexpected family obligation meant I couldn't do my usual evening routine, sleep dropped to 6.1 hours, and Friday I was dragging. Skipped the planned snack and ended up at 1,890 kcal - under target but not ideal distribution. Friday's workout (W21) happened but felt like I was moving through mud. Form was okay but energy was low, plank holds only 48-50 seconds. The fatigue carried into weekend eating - Saturday I went over by about 280 kcal (2,376 total) with some unplanned nuts and an extra yogurt trying to boost energy.

Sunday meal prep took the full 2 hours because I was moving slower, but I got it done. Batch-cooked chicken thighs this time for variety, prepped overnight oats, and portioned lentils. The positive: knee is still completely pain-free, I'm definitely seeing continued body recomposition (pants even looser, arms looking more defined), and when I get 7+ hours sleep the workouts feel dramatically better. The challenge: this week showed how quickly sleep deprivation cascades into everything else. Water intake dropped to 2.2L average when I'm tired. Budget came in at 32 SAR over for the week - bought some emergency protein bars Thursday that I didn't end up needing, and splurged on better quality chicken.

Scale shows minimal change but measurements tell a different story - waist down another half centimeter, and my work pants are legitimately getting loose enough I might need to consider sizing down soon. The strength gains are real and consistent when I'm rested. Next week I need to protect sleep more aggressively, especially mid-week when work pressure builds."
P10,2026-W08,26.5,25,69.1,2207,6.7,"Week 8 was a mixed bag that tested my resilience. Started strong Monday with W33 - felt powerful during planks (52-54sec holds), and my shoulders looked noticeably more defined in the mirror. Sleep Sunday night was solid at 7.1h which set me up well. Tuesday's pre-packed lunch strategy continues to be my anchor - avoided the shawarma temptation again, saved another 15 SAR. But Wednesday hit hard: only 6.2h sleep due to work stress, and the W29 workout felt like dragging through mud. My legs were heavy during squats, and I cut 3 minutes off the session just to get through it.

Thursday was my breaking point - completely skipped meal prep after another 6.3h sleep night, ordered a chicken bowl (18 SAR, still reasonable), but then stress-ate an entire bag of dates in the evening pushing me to 2,410 kcal. Friday's W21 workout was surprisingly decent despite fatigue - maybe the extra carbs helped? Plank holds at 49-51sec, not my best but respectable given the week's chaos.

Weekend was recovery mode: Saturday I slept 7.4h and did a simplified meal prep (90 min instead of usual 2h - just chicken, rice, and roasted vegetables). Sunday I felt human again with 7.2h sleep. My pants are definitely looser around the waist, and I can see more definition in my arms when I flex. The scale barely moved but my body is clearly changing.

The sleep-performance connection is undeniable now. When I get 7+ hours, everything clicks - workouts feel strong, I make better food choices, I drink more water (hit 2.5L on good days, dropped to 1.9L on bad days). The sub-6.5h nights create a domino effect of poor decisions. My knee continues to be completely pain-free, which is huge. Budget was 28 SAR over due to Thursday's emergency meal and premium protein powder restock. Overall adherence around 56-57% - slight dip from last week but considering the sleep disruption, I'm proud I didn't completely derail."
P10,2026-W09,26.1,25.1,68.9,2180,6.8,"Week 9 wrapped up and honestly, it felt like a breakthrough week despite some familiar struggles. Started strong Monday with W33 - that 40-minute session felt powerful, plank holds hitting 53-55 seconds consistently. My body is definitely adapting. Tuesday was my usual win day - pre-packed lunch saved me again from the shawarma temptation, and I'm noticing this is becoming automatic now, which feels amazing.

Wednesday's W29 workout was solid at 38 minutes, though I could feel the sleep deficit creeping in (only 6.4 hours). The real test came Thursday - another rough night at 6.1 hours sleep, and I made the conscious choice to grab a quick chicken bowl (19 SAR) rather than skip eating entirely or stress-eat junk. Still went over on dates in the evening (about 150g this time, learning to portion better), hitting around 2,340 kcal, but that's improvement from last week's 2,410 crisis.

Friday's W21 workout surprised me - 37 minutes, plank holds 50-52 seconds even with accumulated fatigue. My knee continues to be completely pain-free, which gives me so much confidence in every movement. Saturday meal prep was another 90-minute simplified session (chicken thighs, rice, roasted cauliflower and carrots), and I'm accepting this is my sustainable rhythm right now.

The scale barely moved (-0.2kg), but my pants are legitimately loose now - I had to tighten my belt one notch this week. My arms show definition even when relaxed, not just flexed. The mirror tells a different story than the scale, and I'm learning to trust that. Sleep averaged 6.8 hours (range 6.1-7.3h), water intake steady at 2.3L average.

Budget was 24 SAR over (Thursday meal + weekend grocery premium cuts), but I'm prioritizing protein quality and it's showing in my recovery. Weekly average came in around 2,180 kcal - still 21 over target daily, but a significant improvement from Week 8's 187 over. I'm seeing the pattern: when I get 7+ hours sleep, everything clicks. When I dip below 6.5 hours, I need better emergency protocols.

Three workouts completed, diet adherence around 60% (up from 57% last week), and visible body recomposition continuing. I feel stronger, my endurance is building, and I'm developing systems that work for my real life. Not perfect, but definitely progressing."

The grilled fish dinners were simple enough even for my cooking skills. I did notice I'm sleeping pretty well, around 7 hours most nights. I can feel some soreness in my legs and arms, which I guess means I'm working muscles I haven't used in a while. The scale shows a small drop which is encouraging for my fat loss goal.

The workouts were brutal - I'm a beginner and these 'Advanced' gym sessions were way too much. I could only complete about half the exercises properly on upper body days, and my legs were so sore after the first leg workout that the second one on day 4 was really rough.

The meal prep was simple enough for my beginner cooking skills, though I definitely skipped snacks on busier days. The 3000+ calorie target felt really high at first - I'm used to eating less structure. Workouts were tough; the programming seemed advanced for where I'm at, so I scaled back weights and took longer rests. By Wednesday I was pretty sore from Monday's session. My energy dipped mid-week, probably because I'm only getting about 6-7 hours of sleep with work stress. The budget of 35 SAR per day was tight but doable when I stuck to basics like chicken, rice, and eggs. I noticed I felt less bloated by the weekend, and my pants fit slightly better. The scale moved a bit which is encouraging. I think if I can be more consistent with the snacks and maybe get an extra 30 minutes of sleep, I'd see better results. Overall, I'd say I followed the plan about 55-60% of the time - not perfect but a solid start."
P11,2025-W48,33.7,42,106.1,2510,6.6,"Week 48 was challenging but manageable. Started at 106.9kg with decent motivation to tackle fat loss. The diet plan at 3262 kcal felt too high for my fat loss goal, so I naturally undershot it most days, averaging around 2500 kcal. My 55% adherence propensity showed up exactly as expected - I did well with main meals but consistently missed afternoon snacks on Days 2, 4, and 6 due to back-to-back work meetings and simply forgetting to prep my snack containers the night before.

Workouts were tough but completed. Alternating W25 and W21 four times this week pushed me hard as a beginner. I had to scale everything down - used about 30% lighter weights than prescribed and took longer rest periods between sets. By Day 3, the DOMS hit hard in my legs and chest. Walking up stairs at work became a slow, painful process. The soreness peaked around Day 4-5, making me question if I overdid it, but I pushed through the remaining two workouts anyway, just with even more conservative weights.

Sleep stayed consistent at my usual 6.6 hours. I know I should be getting more for recovery, especially with the new training load, but work deadlines and evening habits kept me up. I felt the fatigue accumulating by mid-week - that groggy, heavy feeling in the afternoon that even coffee couldn't fully fix.

Budget management was key. At 35 SAR per day, I bulk-bought chicken breast (8kg), 5 dozen eggs, and large bags of oats and rice from the wholesale market. This kept costs down but made meals repetitive. Grilled chicken with rice became my default. Breakfast was always scrambled eggs or oats with protein powder. My beginner cooking skills meant I stuck to simple preparations - no fancy seasonings, just salt, pepper, and occasionally some hot sauce for variety.

Hydration was my weak point. I'd start the day with good intentions but by afternoon I'd realize I'd only had one bottle of water. This probably contributed to feeling more fatigued and might have impacted recovery.

The scale showed a small drop by week's end - about 0.8kg down to 106.1kg. Some of that is probably water weight and glycogen depletion from the caloric deficit and new training stimulus. I feel slightly leaner around my midsection, though it's hard to tell definitively after just one week. Muscle mass stayed roughly stable, maybe a tiny increase from the newbie gains phenomenon, but realistically it's too early to see significant changes.

Body fat percentage dropped minimally from 34.2% to about 33.7% - a small win but in the right direction. The combination of mild caloric deficit (actual intake vs expenditure) and resistance training is the right formula, I just need to stay consistent.

Overall, I'd rate this week a moderate success. I proved I can stick to the workout schedule even when sore and tired. Diet adherence needs improvement, particularly with snack timing and hydration. The 55% adherence propensity feels accurate - I'm not perfect, but I'm showing up more often than not. Next week I need to: 1) prep snack containers in advance, 2) set phone reminders to drink water, 3) maybe reduce workout intensity slightly to avoid burnout, and 4) try to get to bed 30 minutes earlier at least 3 nights."
P11,2025-W49,33.3,42.1,105.3,2510,6.6,"Week 49 was a challenging but productive start to my fat loss journey. As a beginner, I knew the advanced workout programming would be tough, and it definitely was. The first workout on Monday hit me hard - I had to drop the weights significantly from what W25 prescribed, probably using about 70% of the recommended loads. My form wasn't perfect, but I focused on learning the movements safely.

The DOMS kicked in hard on Day 3. My chest and legs were incredibly sore, making even simple tasks like sitting down or reaching for things painful. I pushed through workout 2 on Wednesday, but again had to modify - longer rest periods, lighter weights, and I skipped one of the accessory exercises because my legs were still screaming.

Diet-wise, I stuck to simple foods I could manage: grilled chicken breast, white rice, scrambled eggs, oatmeal, and protein shakes. My cooking skills are basic, so I batch-cooked 2kg of chicken on Sunday and Wednesday nights. The 35 SAR daily budget was tight but manageable - I bought in bulk from a local wholesale market which helped stretch the money. A 8kg chicken pack, 5 dozen eggs, 5kg rice, and 2kg oats lasted most of the week.

I definitely missed my afternoon snacks on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Work meetings ran long, and I simply forgot to prep them in the morning. On those days, I felt more hungry in the evening and my energy dipped noticeably during the afternoon. I compensated by eating slightly larger dinners, but still stayed under my target calories.

Sleep remained consistent at 6.6 hours - not ideal, but that's my reality with work and family commitments. I noticed by Friday and Saturday I was accumulating fatigue. The combination of caloric deficit, intense workouts (even modified), and limited sleep made me feel drained by the weekend.

Hydration was a weak point. I aimed for 3-4 liters daily but realistically only hit 1.5-2 liters most days. I need to keep a water bottle at my desk as a visual reminder.

The positives: I completed all 4 scheduled workouts despite the difficulty. I'm learning proper form gradually. The scale moved down slightly, which is motivating. My adherence to the diet on the days I prepped properly was solid - around 55% overall as expected, but closer to 80% on prep days.

Looking ahead, I need to: 1) Set phone reminders for snacks, 2) Keep water visible at work, 3) Accept that I'm a beginner and the advanced programming needs serious modification, 4) Maybe add a 20-minute walk on rest days for active recovery. Overall, I'm cautiously optimistic but realistic about the long road ahead."
P11,2025-W50,32.8,42.2,104.5,2700,6.6,"Week 2 showed modest improvements but highlighted persistent challenges. The persona continued struggling with the high caloric target (3079 kcal) - actual intake averaged around 2650 kcal/day due to budget constraints, time pressure, and beginner cooking skills limiting meal variety. Workouts W25 and W21 became more familiar, with intensity gradually increasing from 65% to 75% of prescribed loads by week's end. DOMS was less severe than Week 1, suggesting adaptation. Sleep remained suboptimal at 6.6 hours average, contributing to afternoon energy crashes and missed snacks (Days 2, 4, 6). The 55% adherence propensity manifested as consistent 'good enough' execution rather than perfection - protein targets were hit 5/7 days, but carb intake lagged. Weekend routine disruption (Day 6) and meeting conflicts (Days 2, 4) remained barriers. Positive notes: confidence improved with exercise familiarity, meal prep rhythm establishing, no injuries. The 35 SAR/day budget was stretched but managed through bulk rice, chicken, and eggs. Hydration improved slightly to 2.1L/day but still below 3L target. The persona reported feeling 'less overwhelmed' but 'chronically tired' - likely from caloric deficit combined with poor sleep. Newbie gains appear to be preserving muscle despite energy deficit."
P11,2025-W51,32.5,42.3,103.8,2728,6.6,"Week 3 is complete and I'm seeing the pattern more clearly now. Started strong Monday and Tuesday with workouts, but the sleep debt is really catching up with me. That 6.2 hours Monday night left me dragging Tuesday, and I skipped breakfast again - becoming a bad habit when I oversleep and rush out. The budget is holding at 34 SAR/day which feels sustainable, but I'm noticing I'm choosing cheaper carb sources over quality proteins sometimes to stay under budget. Wednesday's workout felt surprisingly good despite the fatigue - maybe my body is adapting? Thursday I completely forgot my afternoon snack again during back-to-back meetings. Need to set a phone alarm or something. Friday's session was solid, hit 76% intensity and really pushed on the squats. Felt accomplished. Weekend was mixed - Saturday I went to my cousin's place and the social eating threw me off plan. Ate way more bread and rice than intended, probably hit 3100 kcal. Felt guilty but also recognized I can't be a hermit. Sunday I got back on track with meal prep and a decent workout. Overall adherence was about 60% this week - better than Week 1 but worse than Week 2. The scale is moving down slowly which is encouraging, but I'm frustrated by the inconsistency. My energy levels are all over the place, definitely linked to sleep. Need to prioritize getting to bed earlier, but work stress makes that hard. Positive note: no injuries, form is improving, and I'm actually enjoying the workouts more than I expected. The DOMS is less severe now."
P11,2025-W52,32.1,42.5,102.9,2757,6.6,"Week 52 was a mixed bag for me. I managed to hit all four scheduled workouts (W25 and W21 alternating), which felt like a solid achievement given my energy levels. The increased calorie target at 3073 kcal was challenging - I consistently underate by 200-400 calories most days, averaging around 2750 kcal. My adherence propensity of 55% played out realistically: I nailed the main meals but that afternoon snack pattern continued to be my Achilles heel. Meetings and work demands meant I skipped snacks on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday again.

Workouts felt good overall. W25 sessions on Monday and Thursday were strong - I'm seeing progressive overload on squats and feeling more confident with form. W21 on Tuesday and Sunday targeted different muscle groups and kept things fresh. Intensity ranged from 74-78%, which felt appropriate for my beginner level. Recovery between sessions was adequate despite the suboptimal sleep.

Sleep remained my biggest struggle, averaging 6.6 hours exactly as my baseline. I tried setting multiple alarms but still overslept twice, causing rushed mornings. The Saturday social meal at my brother's house was inevitable - family gatherings and Saudi hospitality mean refusing food isn't really an option. I estimated around 3200 kcal that day with all the kabsa, grilled meats, and desserts. I don't regret it though; the social connection was worth it.

Budget management was tight but successful. Stuck to 35 SAR/day by choosing local markets for chicken and vegetables, buying eggs in bulk, and making my own protein shakes instead of commercial ones. Had to opt for a smaller lunch portion on Thursday (falafel wrap instead of full chicken plate) to stay within budget, which left me slightly hungry but I managed.

Protein targets were mostly hit (averaging 210g vs 230g target), but carbs were consistently lower than the 368g target - averaged around 320g. Fat intake was close to target. Hydration improved slightly to 2.2L/day after I started keeping a bottle at my desk.

Physically, I'm noticing small changes. Clothes feel slightly less tight around the waist, and I'm recovering faster between sets. The scale moved down modestly, which is expected given the caloric deficit I'm actually running versus the target. Energy levels are okay but that 2pm crash keeps happening - probably the combination of insufficient sleep and meal timing.

For next week, I need to: 1) Prep portable afternoon snacks in advance (dates, nuts, protein bars), 2) Try to get to bed 30min earlier at least 3 nights, 3) Maybe adjust lunch portions up slightly so I'm not as hungry later. The workout progression is working, so I'll keep that consistent."
P11,2026-W01,32.3,42.6,103.4,3049,6.5,"Week 2 was a mixed bag. I hit all 4 workouts again which felt great - W25 on Monday and Wednesday, W21 on Friday and Sunday. The progression is real, added weight on deadlifts and overhead press. But honestly, the diet side was rougher this week. That 3048 kcal target feels massive when I'm used to running a deficit. I kept overshooting or undershooting, never quite hitting the mark.

Monday started strong with meal prep from Sunday, but by Wednesday I was already tired of the same foods. Thursday I caved and got a lamb shawarma plate instead of my planned chicken - tasted amazing but blew the budget by 12 SAR for the day. The afternoon snack thing is still my Achilles heel - I only remembered it 2 out of 7 days this week. Work gets hectic and I just forget to eat between lunch and dinner.

Sleep was about the same, averaging 6.5 hours. I know I need more but with early morning workouts and work commitments, something's gotta give. The fatigue caught up with me on Saturday - I was supposed to do W25 but my body just said no. Took an extra rest day instead, felt guilty but probably needed it.

The higher calorie target is making me feel a bit bloated and less lean than last week. I know it's supposed to fuel the workouts, but psychologically it's hard after seeing progress on the deficit. My clothes fit about the same, maybe slightly tighter around the waist. Weight is up a bit but I'm trying not to obsess over the scale.

Budget-wise, I averaged 36.2 SAR/day - went over by about 8 SAR for the week total. That Thursday splurge and an unplanned coffee shop visit on Tuesday added up. Need to be more disciplined there.

Positives: Workout consistency is there, strength is improving, energy during training sessions is noticeably better with more food. Negatives: Diet adherence around 60%, snack timing still terrible, budget slightly over, sleep unchanged. The 3000+ calorie target just feels like too much food for someone trying to lose fat, even though I understand the programming logic."
P11,2026-W02,32.5,42.8,104.1,2911,6.4,"Week 2 of this bulk phase done. Hit 3 out of 4 planned workouts again - consistency is there but not perfect. The 2960 kcal target felt more manageable this week compared to last week's accidental 3049 average. Actually came in slightly under most days which was a relief for the budget. Still struggling with afternoon snacks - only remembered them twice. The sleep situation isn't improving, averaging 6.4 hours when I know I need 7-8 for proper recovery. 

Workouts felt strong overall - W25 sessions on Monday and Wednesday were solid, though Wednesday my legs were still tired from Monday. The W21 sessions on Friday and Sunday were highlights - hit a deadlift PR on Friday adding 5kg, and overhead press form finally clicked on Sunday. Body definitely feels heavier though, waist is tighter in my clothes and I'm looking less defined. The scale confirms it.

Budget was better this week at 34.8 SAR/day average versus last week's 36.2 overage. That unplanned manakeesh on Tuesday last week taught me a lesson. Stuck to meal prep more consistently and chose falafel wrap on Sunday which was cheaper than my usual protein options. 

The mental game is harder than I expected. I'm seeing the scale go up as planned for this bulk, but the mirror shows more softness around my midsection and I don't love it. I know this is temporary and necessary to build muscle, but my primary goal is still fat loss long-term. Trying to trust the process. The strength gains are motivating though - that's real progress I can measure.

Hydration still subpar at around 2.2L/day. Need to keep a bottle at my desk. The afternoon snack skipping is becoming a pattern - work gets busy and I just forget. Might need to set a phone alarm. Overall, this feels sustainable but not optimal. I'm doing okay, not great."
P11,2026-W03,32.6,42.9,104.5,2890,6.3,"Week 3 felt like a mixed bag - started strong but hit some real-world friction mid-week. The new meal plan was more ambitious than last week's, and my beginner cooking skills showed. Monday's grilled chicken with roasted vegetables went well, but Tuesday's attempted fish dish took way longer than expected and I ended up ordering a shawarma wrap instead (stayed within budget at least). Wednesday I nailed the breakfast meal prep but completely forgot my afternoon snack during a work crisis. Thursday was my low point - only got 5.9 hours sleep, felt exhausted, and skipped the W25 workout. Felt guilty but also knew pushing through would've been counterproductive.

Friday I bounced back with a solid W21 session - the deadlifts felt heavy but I completed all sets at 79% intensity. The weekend was better for adherence. Saturday's rest day I actually meal prepped properly for once, though I simplified some recipes to match my skill level. Sunday's W25 workout was tough (legs still recovering) but I pushed through at 75% intensity for 44 minutes instead of the planned time.

Nutrition-wise, I averaged around 2,890 kcal daily - close to target but not perfect. Protein hovered around 208g most days. The afternoon snack remains my Achilles heel - only remembered it 3 out of 7 days. Budget management improved slightly at 34.2 SAR/day average. One splurge on kunafa Thursday evening (10 SAR) after the missed workout, which I don't feel great about but it happened.

Body-wise, the scale crept up another 0.4kg despite being in a supposed deficit. Waistband definitely tighter, which is frustrating given the effort. Energy levels varied wildly with sleep - the nights I got 6.8+ hours I felt capable, but the 5.9-6.2 hour nights were rough. The beginner workout intensity is getting more manageable though, and I'm noticing better form on compound movements.

Completed 3 out of 4 planned workouts (75% adherence). Sleep averaged 6.3 hours - actually worse than last week. The 55% adherence propensity feels about right - I'm trying hard but life keeps interfering. Need to simplify meal prep further and maybe set phone reminders for that afternoon snack."
P11,2026-W04,32.4,43.1,104.8,2890,6.2,"Week 4 was a grind. Started strong Monday and Tuesday, hitting workouts with decent intensity despite the ongoing sleep debt. The meal prep Sunday helped, but I'm still struggling with afternoon snacks - only remembered them 4 out of 7 days. Wednesday's W25 workout was brutal on 6.1 hours of sleep, but I pushed through at 76% intensity. Thursday I completely crashed - missed the W21 workout entirely. Woke up feeling like I'd been hit by a truck after only 5.8 hours sleep. Made the smart call to rest instead of forcing it. Friday I bounced back with a solid W25 session, felt redeemed. The simplified meal prep is helping - I'm learning that fancy recipes aren't worth the stress for my skill level. Saturday's rest day was productive, batch-cooked chicken and rice. Sunday's final W21 was tough but completed at 78% intensity. The afternoon snack thing is still my Achilles heel - I either forget during work chaos or I'm just not hungry enough. Budget stayed tight at 34.8 SAR/day, even with one shawarma emergency meal. Weight barely moved (+0.3kg) but waist feels slightly tighter, so maybe body recomp is happening? Sleep averaged 6.2 hours again - this is becoming a pattern I need to address. Overall: 3 out of 4 workouts completed (75% adherence), which matches my 55% propensity when you factor in the sleep debt and beginner fatigue. Protein intake stayed high (avg 206g), calories slightly under target. I'm seeing small wins but the exhaustion is real. Need to prioritize sleep next week or I'll keep missing workouts."
P11,2026-W05,32.1,43.4,105.3,2947,6.1,"Week 5 complete and honestly feeling conflicted. Started strong Monday and Tuesday, crushed W25 on Wednesday despite exhaustion, but Thursday I hit a wall again and skipped W21 - second time in two weeks missing Thursday workouts. My body's screaming that 4 days might be too much on 6 hours sleep. Friday I bounced back hard, best workout intensity yet at 79%, legs felt powerful. Weekend was solid - meal prep is becoming routine now, taking less mental energy. Sunday's W21 closed out the week at 78% which felt like a victory lap. 

Diet adherence was better this week - hit afternoon snacks 5/7 days, meal prep Sunday paid dividends all week. Averaged 2,947 kcal (187 under target but close enough). Protein averaged 211g, slightly under 235g target but adequate for recovery. Budget came in at 34.2 SAR/day, comfortable margin. 

The concerning pattern: sleep averaged 6.1 hours again, and I can feel it accumulating. Thursday's crash wasn't random - it was debt collection. My body needed that rest more than another workout. I'm learning to listen rather than push through stupidly.

Scale showed +0.5kg to 105.3kg but waist is down another ~0.8cm and belt notch is looser. Clothes fitting better, face looks less puffy in mirror. Muscle feels denser, especially legs and shoulders. This slow recomp is working even if scale doesn't show dramatic drops.

Week 5 reality check: 3/4 workouts (75% adherence, same as last week), but the three I did were QUALITY. Sleep debt is my biggest enemy right now. Need to prioritize 7 hours minimum or accept 3 workouts/week might be smarter than forcing 4 and crashing. Body composition changing faster than weight, which is the goal. Cooking skills improving - made shakshuka without burning it, meal prep took 85 minutes instead of 90. Small wins adding up.

Biggest lesson: Rest days aren't failure, they're strategy. Thursday's skip probably made Friday's strong performance possible. Learning sustainable pace over heroic effort."
P11,2026-W06,31.9,43.6,105.6,2890,6,"Week 6 was a grind that taught me hard lessons about recovery debt. Started ambitious but my body had other plans - that accumulated sleep deficit from previous weeks finally caught up. The Thursday collapse wasn't surprising in hindsight; I'd been running on fumes. What's frustrating is I KNOW the signs now but still pushed too hard early week. The positive? Friday's workout after forced rest proved rest isn't weakness - it's strategy. My squat form felt cleaner than it has in weeks, and I actually enjoyed the session instead of white-knuckling through it.

Diet adherence was solid when I had energy to prep, but Wednesday and Thursday saw me reaching for quick fixes - more dates than planned, that emergency shawarma order Thursday night when I was too tired to cook. The afternoon snack routine is becoming automatic on good days, which feels like a real win. Budget stayed under control at 34.8 SAR/day, mostly because exhaustion killed my appetite mid-week.

The scale and mirror tell different stories. Weight up slightly to 105.6kg, but my work pants are definitely looser in the waist. I'm learning to trust the process even when the number goes up - that Friday workout proved I'm building something real under the fat. Sleep averaged 6.0 hours again, and I can feel it in my recovery, my mood, my decision-making around food. That's the next frontier - I can't out-train or out-eat chronic sleep deprivation.

Missing Saturday's W25 stung, but I made the call Friday night when I could barely keep my eyes open at 9 PM. Old me would've set the alarm anyway and suffered through a garbage workout. New me chose 7.1 hours of sleep instead, and Sunday's W21 was strong because of it. That's growth, even if the adherence percentage doesn't reflect it.

Week 7 needs a reality check: I'm programming 4 workouts but consistently hitting 3. Maybe it's time to officially plan for 3 quality sessions instead of 4 compromised ones. The body recomp is happening - slowly, messily, but happening. Just need to stop fighting my biology and work WITH my actual capacity."
P11,2026-W07,31.7,43.5,105.2,2845,5.9,"Week 7 was a grinding test of willpower against chronic sleep debt. Started Monday exhausted from previous week's pattern, and that fatigue shadowed every decision. Managed 3 of 4 planned workouts (75% adherence) - skipped Thursday's W21 when I woke feeling like I'd been hit by a truck after 5.4 hours of broken sleep. The workouts I completed were solid though: Monday's W25 at 76% felt mechanical but doable, Wednesday's W25 at 80% was surprisingly strong after forcing myself to bed earlier Tuesday, and Sunday's W21 at 77% closed the week decently. Friday's scheduled W21 got bumped because work ran late and I chose sleep over a midnight gym session - first time I've made that choice consciously and it felt right.

Diet adherence hovered around 60% of plan. Hit protein targets 4 out of 7 days, averaging 198g (26g under target). Calories averaged 2,845 kcal, about 137 under goal. The afternoon snack routine held strong at 6/7 days - dates and almonds or Greek yogurt became my anchor. Tuesday I stress-ate an extra shawarma wrap during a work crisis (unplanned +680 kcal), and Saturday night I raided the fridge for labneh and bread around 11 PM after waking up hungry. Budget stayed tight at 34.2 SAR/day by repeating chicken thighs, eggs, and bulk rice.

Sleep remains my Achilles heel: averaged 5.9 hours, with Thursday's crash at 5.4 hours being the low point. Only managed 6.8 hours Saturday night when I physically couldn't stay awake past 9 PM. The cumulative deficit is real - I'm irritable, my workout recovery is slower, and I'm constantly fighting sugar cravings (demolished 8 dates on Thursday in one sitting).

Body changes are subtle but present: weight dropped 0.4kg to 105.2kg, waist down another 0.3cm. Mirror shows slightly less puffiness in my face. Energy in workouts is inconsistent - when rested I feel strong, when depleted I'm just going through motions. The pattern is clear: I need to prioritize 7+ hour nights or this whole effort will stall. Next week I'm blocking 10 PM bedtime on my calendar like a meeting. Can't out-train a sleep deficit, and I'm living proof."
P11,2026-W08,31.6,43.5,104.9,3095,5.9,"Week 8 felt like a turning point in self-awareness. Started strong Monday with solid W25 execution despite lingering fatigue from previous weeks. The 5.9hr sleep average continues to haunt me - I know it's my biggest barrier but work demands haven't eased. Tuesday's rest day turned chaotic when a client emergency had me at the office until 9 PM, grabbed fast food on the way home (shawarma plate, not planned, ~850 kcal overage). Wednesday I bounced back with excellent W21 form, finally feeling the mind-muscle connection on bench press. Thursday's W25 session happened but at only 70% intensity - legs were concrete, cut it to 38 minutes instead of pushing through stupidly. Friday I made the mature call to skip W21 entirely when I woke after 5.1 hours feeling like a zombie. Saturday's rest included meal prep which saved Sunday. Sunday's W21 was methodical and controlled, not heroic but consistent. Hit 3 of 4 workouts (75% adherence matching my propensity perfectly). Nutrition was messier - Tuesday's blowout and a late-night Thursday snack raid (dates and labneh binge while watching highlights, ~420 kcal) pushed weekly average to 3,095 kcal, about 85 under target but with wildly uneven distribution. Protein stayed decent at 201g average. The afternoon snack protocol held at 5/7 days. Budget crept to 36.8 SAR/day due to emergency takeout and some pre-made protein sources when I was too tired to cook. Body composition barely moved - maybe 0.3kg down but could be water fluctuation. Waist feels slightly less bloated. The real win was mental: I'm learning when to push and when to preserve. Sleep debt is killing gains but I'm working with what I have. Next week I need to nail meal prep Sunday to avoid Tuesday-style chaos."
P11,2026-W09,31.5,43.5,104.7,3089,5.9,"Week 9 was a grind that tested my resolve more than my muscles. Started strong Monday with W25, felt controlled and methodical despite the chronic sleep debt. Tuesday's client emergency shattered my nutrition plan—that late-night shawarma was survival mode, not a choice. Wednesday bounced back beautifully; the 6.2hrs sleep made a real difference and my bench press felt powerful. Thursday I made the smart call to cut W25 short when my legs were screaming, but then sabotaged myself with that midnight date-and-labneh raid while doom-scrolling. Friday's missed W21 was necessary—my body was wrecked from 5.1hrs sleep and I'm learning not to force it. Saturday's meal prep session was clutch, setting up next week's success. Sunday closed strong with W21 at 79%, no heroics but solid execution.

The pattern is clear now: when sleep dips below 5.5hrs, everything falls apart. My adherence propensity of 55% played out exactly—hit 3 of 4 workouts (75%), but nutrition was volatile with that Tuesday spike and Thursday raid. The meal prep investment on Saturday felt like taking control back. Budget crept to 37.1 SAR/day due to emergency takeout and convenience items when exhausted, but that's reality when working 13-hour days.

Weight barely moved (-0.2kg to 104.7kg), which is frustrating but expected given the calorie volatility and water retention from stress. Body composition feels slightly tighter in the mirror despite the scale, maybe from those three solid workouts. The 5.9hrs average sleep is killing my progress—I know it, but client demands aren't changing. Next week I need to protect that 6+ hour threshold at least 4 nights, even if it means saying no to late calls. The meal prep system works; I just need to defend my boundaries better when chaos hits."

I managed to stick to the meal plan about 80% of the time. The Shakshouka breakfast became my favorite - so filling and delicious. I did swap the Jareesh for grilled chicken with quinoa twice because I was short on time. The labneh snack was perfect post-workout. I noticed I'm getting stronger on my lifts, particularly on back day. My shoulders felt a bit fatigued by the end of the week, so I made sure to stretch more. Energy levels were solid throughout, though I could feel the calorie surplus helping with recovery. The dates gave me a great pre-workout boost.

P12,2025-W47,28.3,20.2,54.7,2095,7.4,"Week 47 was a solid week overall with 4 out of 5 planned workouts completed. I had to skip one session on Thursday due to work running late and feeling mentally exhausted - my adherence propensity kicked in but the day just got away from me. The diet adherence was good for 5 days, hitting around 2050-2100 kcal with macros close to target. On Saturday, I had a family gathering and estimated I went over to about 2300 kcal with higher carbs and fats, but I didn't stress about it. Sunday I pulled back slightly to balance things out. Energy levels were good throughout the week, and I'm definitely feeling stronger on my compound movements - added 2.5kg to my squats which felt amazing! The pump during upper body days was noticeable, especially shoulders and arms. Sleep was consistent at 7.5-7.8 hours most nights except Wednesday when I only got 6.5 hours due to late-night work deadline. Hydration improved after setting phone reminders - aiming for 2.5L daily and hit it 5 out of 7 days. My budget of 60 SAR/day worked well; I meal prepped on Sunday which saved money and kept me on track. Next week I want to focus on progressive overload across all major lifts and maybe add an extra 10g protein to support the muscle gain goal. Overall feeling positive and motivated!"
P12,2025-W48,28.1,20.4,55,2143,7.3,"Week 48 complete! I managed to stick to 4 out of 5 planned workouts again, which feels consistent with my pattern. Monday started strong with W03 - felt energized and pushed through the upper body work with good form. Tuesday I tackled W07 and definitely felt the leg work, some mild DOMS setting in by evening. Wednesday was my rest day which I needed. Thursday was supposed to be W11 but I had a work deadline that ran late and I was mentally exhausted - decided to prioritize sleep over forcing a workout. Friday I bounced back with W15 and felt powerful, especially on the compound movements. Saturday was W21 and I felt the week's fatigue but pushed through with slightly lighter weights on accessories.

Diet-wise, I did really well Monday through Friday, hitting my macros consistently around 2100 calories. Meal prep on Sunday helped enormously - having my protein portions and carbs ready made adherence so much easier. Saturday evening we had a family gathering and I definitely went over, probably around 2400 calories with extra rice, dessert, and some fried appetizers. I don't feel guilty though - it was worth it for the social connection and I got right back on track Sunday.

Sleep averaged about 7.3 hours this week. Wednesday night was rough - only got about 6 hours due to some stress about the Thursday deadline, which probably contributed to skipping that workout. Other nights were solid 7-8 hours. I've been better about my wind-down routine.

Physically, I'm noticing more definition in my shoulders and upper back. The progressive overload is working - added another 2.5kg to my squats this week and hit depth on all reps. My pants are fitting differently around the glutes and quads, which is exciting. Some DOMS on Wednesday and Saturday morning but nothing that limited movement, just that satisfying muscle soreness.

Budget stayed well within limits at about 55 SAR per day. Buying in bulk and meal prepping is definitely the key. Hydration was good - I've been keeping my water bottle at my desk and setting hourly reminders. Overall feeling strong, motivated, and seeing the changes I want. The missed Thursday workout is fine - 80% consistency is still great and sustainable for me."
P12,2025-W49,27.9,20.6,55.3,2185,7.3,"Week 49 is complete and I'm feeling really accomplished! Started Monday strong with W03 upper body - progressive overload on bench press felt challenging but doable. Tuesday's W07 lower body had me really working through those squats, added another 2.5kg as planned. Wednesday I hit W11 full body despite feeling a bit tired from work, but pushed through with good form. Thursday was supposed to be W15 but I had back-to-back meetings that ran late and I was mentally exhausted - decided to skip rather than half-effort it. Friday's W21 HIIT session was intense but energizing heading into the weekend.

Diet adherence was excellent Monday through Thursday, hitting my 2145 kcal target with meal prep making life so much easier. Friday I went slightly over at around 2250 kcal due to a work lunch, but still protein-focused. Saturday was my rest day and I attended a friend's birthday dinner - estimated around 2500 kcal but didn't stress about it, enjoyed the social time. Sunday I got back on track with meal prep for the week ahead, around 2100 kcal.

Sleep was mostly good, averaging 7.3 hours. Had one rough night Tuesday (6.5 hours) due to some work stress, but caught up Wednesday and Thursday with solid 7.5-hour nights. Weekend sleep was amazing at 8 hours each night.

Physically, I'm noticing continued definition in my shoulders and arms - the progressive overload is definitely paying off. DOMS hit hard Tuesday and Friday, especially in quads and glutes, but it's that good sore feeling. Weight is up slightly which I'm attributing to muscle gain and maybe some water retention from the higher carb weekend. My clothes fit better even if the scale moved up a tiny bit.

Budget stayed under control at about 58 SAR/day with my meal prep strategy. Bought chicken breast in bulk, lots of rice, vegetables, and Greek yogurt. The birthday dinner Saturday was my treat for the week.

Overall feeling strong, motivated, and seeing the physical changes I'm working toward. The missed Thursday workout was the right call - listening to my body rather than forcing it. Ready to crush next week!"
P12,2025-W50,27.7,20.8,55.6,2157,7.3,"This week felt like a solid continuation of my muscle gain journey. I managed to hit 4 out of 5 scheduled workouts again, which seems to be my sustainable rhythm given work demands. Monday's W03 session was energizing - I love starting the week strong with upper body work. Tuesday's W07 felt challenging but good, though I could feel fatigue building from the previous week's DOMS. Wednesday's W11 workout was probably my best of the week - I increased weight on my Romanian deadlifts by 2.5kg and felt powerful throughout.

Thursday was another miss, but this time due to a combination of work stress and lingering lower body soreness. I'm learning to recognize when pushing through would be counterproductive versus when I'm just making excuses. This felt like the former - my quads were still tender from Wednesday, and I had back-to-back client presentations that left me mentally drained. Rather than force a subpar workout, I focused on mobility work at home (20 minutes of stretching and foam rolling) and went to bed early.

Friday's W21 session brought back that satisfying burn. I'm noticing my shoulder definition continues to improve - caught myself admiring my deltoids in the gym mirror, which felt like a nice validation of the work I'm putting in. The DOMS hit Saturday morning as expected, particularly in my glutes and hamstrings.

Diet-wise, I maintained strong adherence Monday through Friday, hovering around 2100-2150 kcal as planned. I prepped my meals Sunday evening which made weekday execution smooth. Saturday was my sister's birthday dinner at a nice restaurant - I estimated around 2400 kcal for the day, which included some wine and dessert. I didn't stress about it; these social moments matter, and one day won't derail progress. Sunday I got back on track easily.

Sleep was mostly good this week. I averaged about 7.3 hours, with Tuesday being rough (only 6.5 hours due to anxiety about a work presentation) but I compensated with 8-hour nights on both weekend days. I'm prioritizing this more because I notice the correlation between sleep quality and workout performance.

Budget management continues to work well - averaged about 58 SAR per day. My meal prep strategy of buying in bulk and cooking staples (chicken breast, rice, vegetables) keeps costs reasonable while hitting my macros. The one splurge was Saturday's restaurant meal, but I'd budgeted for that.

Physically, I feel like I'm in a good place. The scale moved up slightly, which aligns with my muscle gain goals. My clothes fit similarly, but I'm noticing more firmness in my arms and shoulders. Energy levels are generally high, and I'm sleeping well most nights. The progressive overload is working - I'm consistently adding small amounts of weight or reps to my main lifts.

Looking ahead, I want to maintain this 4/5 workout consistency while being honest about when rest is needed. My body is responding well to this approach, and I'd rather sustain this long-term than burn out trying to force perfection."
P12,2025-W51,27.5,20.95,55.7,2157,7.3,"This week felt like a true test of consistency and adaptation. Started strong Monday and Tuesday with W03 and W07 workouts—progressive overload on hip thrusts and RDLs is paying off, though I'm definitely feeling the cumulative fatigue in my glutes and hamstrings. Wednesday's W11 session was solid but I could tell my CNS was taxed. 

Thursday was the pivot point. Work stress hit hard with a project deadline, and my Tuesday sleep deficit (6.5 hours) caught up with me. The lingering DOMS from increasing RDL weight made the decision easier—I opted for 20 minutes of mobility work instead of forcing W15. Honestly, this felt like growth. Old me would've pushed through and risked injury or burnout. New me recognizes that muscle is built during recovery, not just in the gym.

Friday's W21 workout was excellent. Felt refreshed and strong, hit new PRs on lateral raises and finished with a solid glute-focused finisher. The extra sleep Thursday night (7.8 hours) made all the difference. Saturday brought expected DOMS—that deep, satisfying ache in glutes and hamstrings that tells me I'm progressing. Did light stretching and foam rolling.

Diet adherence was outstanding on weekdays. Meal prep Sunday paid dividends—having grilled chicken, roasted sweet potatoes, and prepped veggies made hitting 2100-2150 kcal effortless. Saturday was my sister's birthday dinner at a nice restaurant. I enjoyed myself (estimated ~2400 kcal with dessert) without guilt, then normalized Sunday with a balanced 2050 kcal day. The flexible approach keeps me sane.

Sleep averaged 7.3 hours, which I'm proud of given the work stress. Tuesday's 6.5-hour night was rough, but I compensated with 8-hour nights Friday and Saturday. I'm learning my body needs that 7+ hour baseline for optimal recovery and mood.

Physically, I'm seeing continued definition in my shoulders and arms. My delts are really popping, and I caught myself admiring the muscle separation in the mirror post-workout Friday. Weight is stable around 55.6kg, which is expected—I'm likely in a slight recomp phase where I'm adding muscle while maintaining weight. The scale doesn't tell the whole story.

Budget management was excellent at 58 SAR/day average. Buying in bulk (chicken breast, eggs, oats) and shopping seasonal produce keeps costs down. The Saturday restaurant meal was my splurge (~180 SAR for my portion), but I balanced it by keeping other days economical.

Mental health check: I'm feeling empowered. Skipping Thursday's workout without spiraling into guilt is a huge win. I'm learning to listen to my body's signals and trust the process. Four quality workouts beat five mediocre or injury-risking sessions. The progressive overload is working—adding 2.5kg to RDLs might seem small, but it's sustainable progress.

Looking ahead, I want to maintain this balance. Continue prioritizing sleep, especially mid-week. Keep the meal prep routine. Maybe add a sixth mobility/yoga session on rest days to aid recovery. The muscle gain goal is on track—I can feel myself getting stronger, and the visual changes are motivating. This lifestyle is becoming my new normal, not a temporary fix."
P12,2025-W52,27.2,21.15,56.1,2236,7.5,"Week 52 was a solid continuation of my muscle gain trajectory, though the holiday week brought some expected challenges. I completed 4 out of 5 programmed workouts (W03 Mon, W07 Tue, W11 Wed, W21 Sat), strategically skipping W15 Friday due to family holiday preparations and accumulated fatigue. The skip felt justified—I'd pushed hard Monday through Wednesday and my glutes were still talking to me from W11's hip thrusts.

Workout quality remained high. Monday's W03 felt strong; I added another 2.5kg to my RDL working sets (now at 52.5kg for 3x8) and the movement pattern is becoming second nature. Tuesday's W07 upper body session was fantastic—I increased my dumbbell shoulder press to 12.5kg per hand for the first time and completed all reps with good form. Wednesday's W11 leg day was brutal in the best way; hip thrusts at 70kg for 4x10 left me wobbly, and I could feel the glute activation throughout. Saturday's W21 was my Christmas Eve workout—gym was quiet, and I used the opportunity to really focus on mind-muscle connection during lat pulldowns and cable rows.

Diet adherence was approximately 75% this week due to holiday festivities. Monday through Wednesday I hit my targets perfectly (2150-2200 kcal, 135-140g protein). Thursday was Christmas prep with family—I estimate around 2400 kcal with a big dinner at my parents' house (lamb kabsa, lots of rice, baklava for dessert). Christmas Day itself was the biggest deviation: probably hit 2600-2700 kcal with the full celebration meal, though I made conscious choices to load up on protein (grilled chicken, beef, yogurt sides) rather than just carbs and sweets. Friday recovery day I pulled back to around 1900 kcal to balance things out. Saturday and Sunday normalized back to 2100-2150 kcal range.

Protein intake averaged about 125g daily across the week—lower than my usual 135-140g due to the holiday meal structures, but still adequate for muscle maintenance. I noticed I naturally gravitated toward protein-rich options even at social meals, which shows how ingrained the habit has become.

Sleep was actually better than expected: averaged 7.5 hours despite the holiday chaos. Christmas Eve I got a full 8.5 hours, and even with late family gatherings, I prioritized getting to bed by 11:30 PM most nights. Only Tuesday dipped to 6.5 hours due to last-minute gift wrapping.

Recovery-wise, I implemented foam rolling sessions on my rest days (Thursday, Sunday) focusing on quads, IT bands, and upper back. The DOMS from Wednesday's leg session peaked Friday but was manageable. I also did a 15-minute yoga flow Sunday morning that felt amazing for hip mobility.

Budget management was interesting this week. I spent about 62 SAR/day average—slightly over my 60 SAR limit due to holiday grocery shopping (bought extra chicken breast, salmon, and Greek yogurt to have protein options readily available during busy days). The overage felt worthwhile as it prevented me from making poor convenience food choices.

Physique changes continue to be visible. My shoulders have noticeably more definition, especially the lateral delts. I can see striations when I raise my arms overhead. My sister commented on Christmas that my arms look 'toned and strong'—unsolicited feedback is always the best kind! Scale weight is up slightly but I feel leaner, which suggests the recomp is ongoing.

Mentally, I'm really proud of how I navigated this week. Old me would have felt guilty about the holiday meals or skipped workouts entirely due to schedule disruptions. Current me recognizes that 4 quality workouts during a holiday week is a WIN, and that enjoying family meals is part of a sustainable lifestyle. The key was getting right back on track rather than letting one big meal spiral into a week-long break.

Challenges: Mid-week energy dip Wednesday evening after the leg workout—I was absolutely spent and went to bed at 9:30 PM. Also felt some lower back tightness Thursday morning, likely from the heavy RDLs Monday and hip thrusts Wednesday. I addressed it with cat-cow stretches and it resolved by Friday.

Wins: Hitting new PRs on RDL and shoulder press. Maintaining workout consistency despite holiday schedule. Making conscious protein choices at social meals. Getting quality sleep. Not spiraling into all-or-nothing thinking.

Looking ahead to W53, I'm planning to return to full 5-day training schedule and tighten up diet adherence as holiday events wrap up. I want to test a new squat variation (front squats) to add variety and continue pushing progressive overload on upper body pressing movements. Overall satisfaction this week: 8/10. The 2-point deduction is purely for the diet deviations, but I'm at peace with them given the context."
P12,2026-W01,27.1,21.25,56.4,2095,7.5,"Week 1 of 2026 complete! Coming off the holiday period, I was honestly worried about getting back into the swing of things, but my adherence propensity held strong. Hit all 5 workouts this week (W03, W07, W11, W15, W21) which felt like a victory after skipping that Friday session last week.

Monday started with W03 - full body strength work. Energy was solid despite some lingering holiday fatigue. RDLs felt strong at 50kg for working sets, backing off slightly from my 52.5kg PR to focus on form after that lower back tightness incident. Tuesday's W07 upper body session had me pushing the DB shoulder press again - stuck with 12.5kg and got cleaner reps than last time. Shoulders are definitely responding to the progressive overload.

Wednesday's W11 was brutal as usual - high-volume leg day left me absolutely cooked by evening, similar to last week. I've learned to just accept that Wednesday nights are for gentle stretching and early bed. Thursday's W15 (the one I skipped during Christmas week) felt redemptive. Upper body hypertrophy work with great pump. Friday's W21 cardio/conditioning was perfect timing - legs still sore from Wednesday so the lower intensity steady-state work was exactly what I needed.

Diet adherence bounced back to about 85% this week. Budget stayed right at 60 SAR/day since I'm still using the protein stock I bought during the holiday week. Meal prep Sunday helped massively - prepped chicken, rice, and roasted vegetables for Mon-Wed. Thursday and Friday I cooked fresh since I had more time. Hit my protein target of 130g every day except Tuesday (managed 118g - had a lighter lunch). Carbs and fats were on point. Fiber averaged around 32g daily thanks to oats, vegetables, and the occasional apple with almond butter.

Sleep maintained at 7.5 hours average. Monday and Thursday were closer to 8 hours, Wednesday was 6.5 hours (that W11 exhaustion is real), and the rest hovered at 7.5. Hydration back to consistent 2.8-3L daily now that I'm not in holiday mode.

DOMS was manageable - foam rolling after each session plus 10-15 min mobility work before bed on heavy training days. Lower back feels completely resolved. No tightness or discomfort even during RDLs and squats. The extra stretching and awareness is paying off.

Physically, I'm seeing continued shoulder definition and my quads are looking more developed. Weight is trending up slightly which is exactly what I want for muscle gain phase. Energy levels were consistently good except that Wednesday evening crash. No injuries, no concerning pain - just productive training soreness.

Mentally, I'm in a great place. The balanced approach during the holidays proved I can maintain progress without being rigid. Starting the new year with 5/5 workouts completed feels empowering. Family comments from Christmas are still motivating me. I caught myself in the mirror Friday after my shower and genuinely felt proud of the visible changes.

One small challenge: my work schedule picks up this coming week, so I need to be strategic about workout timing. Planning to do early morning sessions Tuesday and Thursday to avoid evening conflicts. Also need to restock vegetables and oats mid-week.

Overall: Excellent week. Adherence high, training quality high, recovery managed well, and I'm seeing the results of consistent effort. The intermediate fitness level is serving me well - I can push hard but recover adequately. Ready for week 2!"
P12,2026-W02,26.8,21.45,56.7,2235,7.3,"Week 2 of 2026 complete! This was a solid training week despite the work schedule intensifying as I anticipated. I managed all 5 workouts (W03/W07/W11/W15/W21) by shifting to early morning sessions on Tuesday and Thursday, which actually worked better than expected - felt energized throughout the day. Diet adherence was around 82%, slightly down from last week's 85% due to two unplanned work lunches where I had to estimate macros. Still hit my protein targets averaging 135g/day, just slightly under the 140g goal but well within acceptable range.

W03 (Monday) felt strong - upper body push session had me hitting new rep PRs on dumbbell press. W07 (Tuesday morning) was challenging at 6 AM but the lower body work felt solid once I was warmed up. W11 (Wednesday evening) again left me depleted - this workout consistently taxes my CNS more than others, noted for future programming adjustments. W15 (Friday) was excellent, full body power work felt explosive. W21 (Saturday) provided good active recovery and mobility work that helped with residual DOMS.

Budget management continues strong at 58 SAR/day average - the holiday stock-up is still paying dividends. Meal prep on Sunday took 2.5 hours but set me up perfectly for the week. I prepped overnight oats, grilled chicken batches, and veggie portions. The early morning workouts required me to have a small pre-workout snack (banana + dates) which I hadn't budgeted initially, but I adjusted dinner portions slightly to compensate.

Sleep averaged 7.3 hours this week, slightly down from my 7.5 target due to the early alarms, but I compensated with a 90-minute afternoon rest on Saturday. Energy levels remained high except post-W11 as usual. Hydration stayed consistent at 2.9L daily average. Foam rolling and mobility work (15 min daily) kept DOMS manageable.

Physique changes becoming more noticeable - shoulders and upper back showing more definition, and I'm filling out my workout tanks better. Weight trending up gradually which aligns with muscle gain goals. No injuries, lower back remains strong and stable. One minor challenge: the work intensity meant I had less mental bandwidth for tracking, so I simplified my food logging to key meals only.

Mental state: very motivated and confident. The early morning training adjustment was initially daunting but proved I'm more adaptable than I thought. Looking forward to Week 3 with the same schedule. Considering adding a sixth workout day in a few weeks if recovery continues this well, but will assess after two more weeks of this pattern."
P12,2026-W03,26.5,21.65,57.1,2235,7.2,"Week 3 was solid overall! I managed to complete all 5 scheduled workouts (W03, W07, W11, W15, W21) though I had to shuffle things around a bit. Tuesday and Thursday I went early morning again at 5:45am to beat work deadlines - that's becoming my go-to strategy when things get hectic. The workouts felt progressively harder, especially W11 which left me pretty wiped that evening, but I recovered well.

Diet adherence was around 80-82% this week, which I'm happy with given my propensity. I hit my protein targets most days, averaging about 138g which is close to the 141g goal. Monday and Wednesday were spot-on, but Friday I had a work lunch that threw things off a bit - ended up around 2100 kcal instead of 2261, but still in a reasonable range. Saturday I went slightly over at 2350 kcal because I was genuinely hungry post-workout and had some extra rice with dinner.

Budget-wise I stayed right around 58-59 SAR per day. I'm getting better at meal prepping on Sundays which helps both the budget and adherence. Bought chicken breast in bulk, lots of rice, eggs, and seasonal vegetables. One splurge was Greek yogurt which is pricier but really helps hit protein targets for breakfast.

Sleep averaged 7.2 hours this week - a tiny bit down from my usual 7.3 due to those two early sessions, but honestly I felt fine. I made sure to get to bed by 10pm on Monday and Wednesday nights to compensate. The DOMS from W03 and W07 were manageable with proper stretching and foam rolling. By mid-week my legs were feeling it from the compound movements, but nothing that stopped me.

Physique-wise, I'm definitely seeing changes! My shoulders look more defined and I can see a bit more muscle tone in my quads. The scale went up slightly which is exactly what I want for muscle gain. Energy levels were excellent except Thursday evening after W11 - that workout really kicked my butt and I was ready for bed by 9pm.

Work intensity picked up this week with Q1 planning meetings, but I managed it well by being strategic with workout timing. The intermediate cooking skills are paying off - I can whip up high-protein meals quickly now. Hydration stayed consistent around 2.8-3L daily, especially important with the increased training volume.

No injuries, no major barriers. Just the usual juggling act of work, training, and life. Feeling strong and motivated going into week 4!"
P12,2026-W04,26.3,21.78,57.4,2089,7.1,"Week 4 was a solid continuation of my muscle gain journey with some interesting challenges. Started strong with Monday's upper body workout (W03) at 6am - felt powerful through all my pressing movements and hit a new personal best on incline dumbbell press. Tuesday required another early 5:45am session for W07 (lower body) due to work meetings, and my quads were absolutely screaming by Wednesday morning. The DOMS from those Bulgarian split squats was next-level, but I foam rolled religiously and it paid off.

Diet adherence came in at 79% this week - slightly below my usual 81% but still respectable given the Q1 planning chaos at work. Wednesday I had an unexpected client dinner that threw off my macro tracking, and I estimate I hit maybe 2400 kcal that day with lower protein (around 110g). Thursday and Friday I course-corrected hard, meal prepping extra chicken and quinoa bowls. My protein averaged 129g/day this week versus my 141g target, which I'm slightly disappointed about but not stressed - still in solid muscle-building range.

W11 on Wednesday (full body) was tough coming off the leg DOMS, but I pushed through and actually felt the workout helped flush out some of the soreness. Friday's W15 (upper body focus) was fantastic - shoulders felt pumped and I'm definitely seeing more definition in my delts. Sunday's W21 (metabolic conditioning) was exactly what I needed to cap the week, though I did feel some fatigue accumulation toward the end.

Sleep averaged 7.1 hours this week - down slightly from my usual 7.2 due to Sunday night insomnia (work stress about Q1 targets). Tuesday and Thursday early sessions meant 10:30pm bedtimes to get adequate rest. Recovery felt good overall despite the slight sleep deficit. Energy levels were high Monday through Thursday, dipped a bit Friday afternoon (classic end-of-week fatigue), but bounced back for the weekend workouts.

Budget performance was excellent at 57.8 SAR/day average. I found a great deal on chicken breast at the local market (18 SAR/kg vs usual 22) and stocked up. Also batch-cooked a big pot of lentil curry on Sunday that carried me through several lunches. The client dinner Wednesday was covered by work, which actually helped keep my personal food spend down.

Physique changes are becoming more noticeable - my work colleague commented that my shoulders look broader, and I can see more quad separation when I'm doing my morning stretches. Weight is trending up gradually which is exactly what I want for muscle gain. The scale showed some daily fluctuation (probably water retention from the higher sodium client dinner and the intense leg work), but the overall trend is positive.

Barriers this week: Work intensity remained high with Q1 planning consuming extra mental energy. Had to reschedule one social coffee meetup to protect my Wednesday rest window. The early morning sessions are sustainable but I definitely feel them accumulating - might need to reassess if work demands increase further. Also realized I need to order more protein powder as I'm running low.

Wins: All 5 workouts completed with good intensity, no injuries, meal prep efficiency is getting better (down to 90 minutes on Sunday for the week's prep), hydration stayed consistent at 2.7L daily average, and I'm genuinely enjoying the training variety. The muscle gain goal feels very achievable at this pace."
P12,2026-W05,26.1,21.93,57.6,2198,7,"Week 5 complete and I'm feeling really solid! Started Monday strong with W03 (upper body) and hit all my sets despite some residual shoulder fatigue from last week. Tuesday's diet was spot-on at 2,210 kcal with 142g protein - meal prep is really paying off. Wednesday's W07 (lower body) was brutal but in the best way - I increased my Bulgarian split squat weight by 2.5kg per hand and felt powerful throughout. Thursday I had a work lunch that threw off my macros slightly (only 125g protein, higher fat at 72g), but I stayed within calories at 2,180. Friday's W11 session felt amazing - my shoulder definition is noticeably better and I'm getting compliments at the gym. Weekend was a mix: Saturday's W15 workout was solid, though I felt a bit fatigued from the week's volume. Sunday's W21 (full body) rounded things out perfectly. Sleep averaged 7.0 hours - one night of poor sleep (5.8hr) on Wednesday due to pre-presentation nerves, but otherwise consistent at 7.1-7.3hr. Diet adherence hit 82% this week, averaging 2,198 kcal/day with protein at 136g/day (just shy of target but acceptable). Budget came in at 58.2 SAR/day - slightly over but worth it for quality protein sources. DOMS was manageable, energy levels stayed high except for Thursday afternoon. The visible changes are motivating me - my quads are more defined and my shoulders have better separation. One minor concern: right hip flexor felt tight during lunges on Saturday, so I foam rolled extra and it's fine now. Overall, this is sustainable and I'm seeing the muscle gain I want!"
P12,2026-W06,25.9,22.05,57.9,2247,6.8,"Week 6 was a solid continuation of my muscle gain phase, though I hit some unexpected challenges mid-week. Started strong Monday and Tuesday with perfect adherence - nailed my workouts W03 and W07, and my meal prep was on point. Energy levels were excellent and I felt really powerful during my upper body sessions.

Wednesday brought the first hiccup - work got crazy with back-to-back meetings running late, and I had to rush through my W11 workout. Still completed it but cut my rest periods shorter than ideal, which affected my last two sets on squats. Dinner was also delayed until 9:30 PM, so I ended up eating lighter than planned (only hit about 1,950 kcal that day). Sleep suffered too - only got about 6.2 hours due to stress from the Q1 presentation revisions.

Thursday I bounced back mentally but my body was feeling the fatigue. W15 workout felt harder than it should have - my shoulder press numbers were down about 5% from last week. I think the sleep debt caught up with me. Diet was good though, hit 2,310 kcal and 145g protein with my post-workout meal doing heavy lifting.

Friday's W21 lower body session was phenomenal! Finally felt recovered and pushed through with great form. Hit a new PR on Romanian deadlifts - 3x8 at 52kg, up from 50kg last week. My glutes and hamstrings are definitely responding to the progressive overload. DOMS kicked in hard Saturday morning though.

Weekend adherence was about 75% - Saturday I had a family gathering and while I made decent choices (grilled chicken, rice, salads), portion control was tough and I probably went over by 200-300 kcal. Sunday I was more disciplined but still dealing with significant leg soreness that made even walking uncomfortable. Did my foam rolling routine twice on Sunday which helped.

Overall diet adherence this week: approximately 79% - slightly down from last week's 82%. Hit protein targets 5 out of 7 days. Budget averaged 59.8 SAR/day which is perfect. All 5 workouts completed but Wednesday's quality was compromised. Sleep averaged 6.8 hours vs my usual 7.0, mainly due to that one bad night.

Physique check in the mirror Sunday night: shoulders and upper back are noticeably more defined. Quads have more separation visible. Waist measurement stable. Weight is trending up slowly as expected on this surplus. Energy and motivation remain high despite the mid-week struggle. Hip flexors feel good - the mobility work is paying off.

Looking ahead: need to protect my sleep better during high-stress work weeks, and maybe prep some quick backup meals for those late meeting nights. Otherwise, the program is working beautifully and I'm seeing consistent strength gains across all major lifts."
P12,2026-W07,25.7,22.15,58.2,2305,6.7,"Week 7 was a solid recovery from the previous week's inconsistencies, though not without its challenges. Started Monday strong with W03 workout and hit my nutrition targets almost perfectly. The DOMS from last week's PR on Romanian deadlifts finally subsided by Tuesday, which was a relief. Wednesday's W07 workout felt excellent - upper body power day had me feeling strong, and I managed to push through despite some lingering work stress from the Q1 presentation aftermath.

Mid-week hit a rough patch Thursday when sleep dropped to 6.3 hours due to a late work call with international colleagues. This affected my W11 workout quality - I completed it but had to reduce intensity slightly on the conditioning portion. Friday's rest day was perfectly timed, and I focused on meal prep which helped keep weekend nutrition on track.

Saturday's W15 lower body session was challenging but productive. I maintained the 52kg Romanian deadlift weight from last week's PR and managed 3x8 with better form. Sunday's W21 conditioning workout was tough - fatigue was accumulating, but my adherence propensity kicked in and I pushed through. The HIIT intervals felt harder than usual, likely due to the cumulative training load.

Nutrition-wise, I achieved 82% adherence this week - an improvement from last week's 79%. Monday, Tuesday, and Friday were near-perfect days hitting 2,290-2,320 kcal. Wednesday I slightly overshot at 2,450 kcal due to adding an extra snack post-workout (underestimated hunger). Thursday's poor sleep led to some stress eating, pushing me to 2,380 kcal. Weekend was more controlled than last week - Saturday at 2,340 kcal and Sunday at 2,250 kcal.

Protein targets were consistently met except Thursday (138g vs 145g target). Budget management remained excellent at 58.7 SAR/day average - my intermediate cooking skills and meal prep discipline really paid off. I made a large batch of chicken and rice on Friday that carried through the weekend.

Physically, I'm noticing continued improvements in shoulder definition and my quads are definitely responding to the progressive overload. Hip flexors remain comfortable with no tightness. Energy levels were good except Thursday. Recovery between sessions felt adequate despite the 5-day training week.

The main barrier this week was sleep consistency - averaged 6.7 hours with that one particularly poor night. I need to be more disciplined about my evening routine, especially when work demands increase. The accumulated sleep debt is subtle but I can feel it affecting recovery and hunger cues.

Overall, a successful week with all 5 workouts completed at good quality (except slightly compromised W11), improved diet adherence, and continued strength progression. The 0.8 adherence propensity is holding strong, though I recognize I need to prioritize sleep better to optimize results."
P12,2026-W08,25.5,22.35,58.6,2287,6.9,"Week 8 complete! Really proud of myself this week - hit all 5 workouts again and managed 86% diet adherence despite some challenging days. The sleep situation improved slightly to 6.9 hours average which made a noticeable difference in my energy levels. Monday's W03 workout felt fantastic, hit a new PR on bench press at 37kg for 3x8 which was exciting! Tuesday's meal prep paid off big time - having those chicken and rice bowls ready made weekday adherence so much easier.

Wednesday's W07 was solid though my shoulders were still feeling Monday's pressing volume. Thursday I had that early morning meeting which cut into sleep (only 6.4 hours) but I pushed through W11 in the evening and surprisingly felt strong on squats. Friday's W15 was probably my best workout of the week - everything clicked and I could really feel the mind-muscle connection on those Romanian deadlifts. Increased to 54kg for 3x8 and form stayed tight.

Weekend was good overall. Saturday's rest day I focused on meal prep and hit my protein target perfectly at 142g. Sunday's W21 metabolic circuit was brutal but in the best way - my conditioning is definitely improving. The DOMS Monday-Tuesday were moderate, manageable with stretching and foam rolling.

Diet-wise, I averaged 2,287 kcal against my 2,210 target (103% - slight surplus but acceptable for muscle gain phase). Protein averaged 140g/day, just shy of my 138g minimum but close enough. Only really missed targets on Wednesday when work got crazy and I skipped my afternoon snack, ended up at 1,950 kcal and 118g protein. Made up for it Thursday and Friday though.

Budget came in at 57.8 SAR/day which is excellent - well under my 60 SAR limit. The bulk chicken breast purchase on Monday (18 SAR/kg) really helped. Also found those frozen vegetable mixes on sale at 8 SAR per bag.

Physically, I'm seeing continued improvements in my shoulders and upper back definition. Quads are getting more pronounced too. Weight is up slightly which is expected with the surplus and muscle gain focus. No injuries, hip flexors still feeling great. The extra 0.2 hours of sleep per night made recovery noticeably better - I wasn't dragging as much mid-week.

Work stress is much lower now that Q1 planning is done. I have more mental energy for training which shows in my performance. Next week I want to focus on getting that sleep average to 7+ hours and maintaining this diet adherence level. Really happy with the consistency!"
P12,2026-W09,25.3,22.48,58.9,2245,6.9,"Week 9 complete! This was a solid continuation of my momentum from the previous two weeks. I managed to hit all 5 workouts again (W03, W07, W11, W15, W21) which makes it three consecutive weeks of 100% workout completion - I'm really proud of that consistency. The diet adherence was around 83% this week, slightly down from last week's 86%, but still well within my typical range given my 0.8 adherence propensity.

Monday started strong with W03 after a good 7.1 hours of sleep. The upper body work felt great and I'm noticing my shoulders are getting more defined. Tuesday's W07 leg day was challenging - still feeling the cumulative fatigue from weeks of consistent training, but I pushed through. Wednesday was my diet slip day - only managed about 1,880 kcal and 115g protein because I had back-to-back meetings and completely forgot my afternoon snack and had to rush dinner. It happens.

Thursday's sleep was rough again at 6.5 hours due to a late work deadline, which made Friday's W11 workout feel harder than usual. My bench press felt heavy and I had to really focus on form. Saturday's W15 was better after catching up on sleep Friday night (7.3 hours). Sunday's W21 full body was excellent - hit a new PR on my barbell rows at 42kg for 3x8, which felt amazing!

Calorie-wise, I averaged about 2,245 kcal/day this week, which is slightly above my 2,161 target but still good for muscle gain. Protein averaged around 137g/day, just under my 135g target. Budget was excellent at 58.2 SAR/day, well under my 60 SAR limit. 

Physically, I'm seeing continued improvements in muscle definition, especially in my back and legs. The scale went up slightly which is expected with the slight calorie surplus. Body fat percentage seems stable or maybe down a tiny bit - my clothes fit the same but I look more toned in the mirror. No injuries or concerning soreness, just normal DOMS after leg days.

Sleep averaged 6.9 hours again this week, same as last week. I really need to work on getting that up to 7+ hours consistently, but work has been demanding. The good news is I'm managing the sleep debt better and don't feel chronically exhausted.

Looking ahead to Week 10, I want to maintain this workout consistency and try to tighten up the diet adherence back to 85%+ by being more proactive about meal prep on Sundays. Overall, feeling strong and motivated!"

I managed to stick to the meal plan about 80% of the time - the ful medames breakfast became my favorite, and the lamb kabsa was delicious. I did swap out a couple of dinners for simpler grilled chicken when I got home late from work. The advanced gym workouts were intense - I felt the chest and leg days especially. My muscles are definitely sore but in a good way. I'm sleeping slightly better, probably from the physical exhaustion. The 2253 calorie target felt like a lot of food at first, but I'm getting used to eating more to support muscle growth.

My arms are noticeably more pumped, and I'm feeling stronger on compound movements. Sleep stayed consistent around 7.5 hours. I'm experiencing some DOMS but it's manageable. The calorie target felt appropriate for muscle gain without excessive fat gain. Looking forward to continuing!"

I did swap the kabsa for grilled chicken with rice twice when I was short on time. The workouts were challenging but manageable at my intermediate level - I appreciated the advanced programming but had to scale back weights on a few exercises, especially on shoulders day. I felt strong during back and legs sessions. My energy levels were consistently high throughout the week, and I noticed I was less hungry between meals thanks to the high protein intake. Recovery was good with 7-8 hours of sleep most nights. I can already feel my muscles responding, especially in my arms and shoulders. One challenge was meal prepping the kabsa, but I got better at it by mid-week. Overall, I'm motivated to continue!"

My chest and shoulder days were particularly strong. I noticed I'm feeling hungrier than usual, which makes sense with the muscle-building focus. Energy levels have been good throughout the week, and I'm sleeping well. The hummus snack is perfect for mid-afternoon. I did go slightly over my calorie target on two days (maybe 2200-2300 kcal) because I added extra protein after particularly tough leg and back sessions.

P13,2025-W47,19,32.45,78.4,2695,7.5,"Week 47 was solid overall. I maintained about 75-80% adherence to the meal plan, which feels realistic given my work schedule and the occasional social commitment. The 2672 kcal target felt appropriate for my training load - I was hungry at the right times and never overly stuffed. Monday and Wednesday I nailed all meals, but Thursday I skipped the mid-morning dates and nuts snack because of back-to-back client calls. Saturday I went slightly over budget eating out with family (maybe 2750 kcal), but I kept it reasonable with grilled chicken and rice. The workouts were challenging but manageable. W03 (chest/triceps) on Monday set a good tone. W07 (shoulders) on Tuesday felt almost too easy - I think I'm ready to increase weights on lateral raises and overhead press next cycle. W11 (back/biceps) Wednesday was solid. Friday's W15 (full body) left me properly worked, and Sunday's W21 (legs with 7 exercises) had me walking funny the next day in the best way. I added 15 minutes of moderate incline walking after Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday sessions to support my endurance goals. Recovery felt good - the 167g protein target helped, and I hit around 160-170g most days thanks to eggs, chicken, laban, and the occasional protein-rich lentil dish. Sleep averaged 7.5 hours, slightly under my usual 7.6 but close enough. The 40 SAR daily budget worked perfectly. Local produce, bulk rice, whole wheat bread, and laban kept costs low. I'm feeling stronger and my cardiovascular capacity is definitely improving with the added cardio. Energy levels were consistent throughout the week. Looking forward to next week and possibly progressing shoulder exercises."
P13,2025-W48,18.9,32.5,78.3,2563,7.4,"Completed Week 48 simulation with solid adherence patterns. Started Monday strong with W03 (Full Body Strength) - the workout felt manageable given my intermediate fitness level. Nutrition tracking went well initially, hitting around 2550 kcal with good macro distribution. Tuesday's W07 (Shoulders & Arms) confirmed my previous notes about needing progression - I'm definitely ready for heavier loads or more volume here.

Mid-week presented the expected minor deviation: Wednesday I had a late work meeting and shifted dinner by 90 minutes, ending up around 2680 kcal due to an unplanned shawarma grab (still within budget at 38 SAR for the day). Thursday's W11 (Back & Core) was excellent - really feeling the endurance adaptations kicking in, maintained heart rate in zone 2-3 throughout.

Friday's rest day I kept active with a 30-minute walk. Saturday's W15 (Chest & Triceps) plus 18 minutes moderate cardio felt efficient. The real highlight was Sunday's W21 (Legs) - quads and glutes are definitely responding well to the programming. Added 20 minutes of incline walking post-workout.

Across the week, I missed one afternoon snack on Tuesday (just forgot it at home), and had that Wednesday dinner timing shift. Overall adherence landed around 76-78% as expected given my propensity. Sleep averaged 7.4 hours - slightly under my usual 7.5 but still adequate for recovery. No soreness beyond normal DOMS, no injuries.

Budget management was successful: averaged 37.5 SAR/day with meal prep on Sunday helping keep costs down. The intermediate cooking skills made it easy to batch-cook chicken, rice, and roasted vegetables. Recovery felt good throughout - the endurance focus is clearly working as I'm handling the volume better each week.

Key observation: I'm noticing better work capacity during the workouts and faster recovery between sets. The post-workout cardio (4 out of 5 training days, 15-20 min) is becoming routine and doesn't feel like a burden anymore. Ready to consider progressive overload on shoulders next cycle."

W07 shoulders definitely needed the progression I'd been thinking about - added 2.5kg to overhead press and felt much better stimulus. W21 legs on Wednesday delivered again, quads are still feeling it on Sunday. Thursday I had a work deadline that pushed dinner back about 2 hours, ended up at around 2710 kcal that day from stress snacking on some extra nuts. Friday's W11 back session was solid, felt my endurance improving on the higher rep sets. Saturday's W15 chest workout went well, though I skipped the post-workout cardio due to time constraints - had family commitments. Post-workout cardio completion was 4/5 days again, maintaining that 15-20 minute moderate intensity window. Budget came in at 38.2 SAR/day average, slightly up from last week but still under my 40 SAR limit. Sleep averaged 7.3 hours, down slightly from my usual 7.4h - Thursday night was rough with only 6.5 hours due to the work stress. Recovery feels good overall, no injuries or concerning soreness. The endurance gains are real - I'm noticing better work capacity between sets and my heart rate recovers faster. Weight is holding steady which is expected given my endurance focus and adequate protein intake. Body composition feels like it's slowly improving even without major scale movement."
P13,2025-W50,18.4,32.7,77.8,2687,7.2,"Week 50 was solid overall, though I hit a few bumps mid-week. Started strong on Monday and Tuesday—meals were on point, workouts felt powerful, and I'm really noticing the endurance gains from the progressive programming. W03 and W07 sessions went smoothly with good energy levels.

Wednesday brought the first challenge: work ran late and I grabbed a quick shawarma meal that pushed me about 95 kcal over target. Not terrible, but I felt slightly sluggish during the W11 workout Thursday morning. Thursday itself was rough—only got 6.8 hours of sleep due to a late project deadline, and I delayed my lunch by about 90 minutes. The fatigue caught up with me, but I pushed through the W15 workout, though my form wasn't as crisp as I'd like.

Friday's W21 session was fantastic—felt like I'd recovered well, and the endurance circuits are really clicking now. My cardiovascular capacity is noticeably better than even three weeks ago. Saturday I had to skip the post-workout cardio due to a family commitment, which was disappointing but unavoidable.

Sunday was a rest day that I actually needed. Meal prep went well, stayed within budget at about 39.1 SAR/day for the week. The diet is feeling sustainable—I'm not experiencing the cravings I used to get, and the macro balance seems to be supporting my training well.

Physically, I'm seeing continued improvements in work capacity. Recovery between sets is faster, and I'm maintaining intensity through longer workout sessions. Body composition seems to be slowly shifting in the right direction. No injuries or significant soreness beyond normal training fatigue.

Looking ahead, I need to protect my sleep better—that one poor night really affected my next-day performance. Otherwise, the adherence is holding steady around 76-78%, which feels realistic and maintainable long-term."
P13,2025-W51,18.2,32.8,77.5,2635,7.2,"Week 51 went reasonably well overall. I maintained my usual adherence pattern around 78%, hitting most of my targets but with a few realistic slip-ups that I've come to expect given my work schedule and lifestyle. Started strong on Monday and Tuesday, completing W03 and W07 workouts with solid energy levels. The diet felt sustainable—I'm getting better at meal prep on Sundays which helps tremendously during the week.

Wednesday brought the first minor deviation: grabbed an extra protein bar mid-afternoon during a long meeting (about +95 kcal over target), but honestly it kept me focused and I don't regret it. Thursday was tougher—had a project deadline that pushed my dinner back by about 90 minutes, which threw off my evening routine slightly. Still got W11 done but felt the fatigue more than usual, probably from the 6.8 hours of sleep that night.

Friday I bounced back well with W15, and my energy levels were restored. Sleep caught up to 7.5 hours which made a huge difference. Saturday was my planned rest day workout-wise, but I did skip the post-workout cardio session I'd intended after W21 on Friday—just ran out of time with family commitments. Completed W21 on Sunday instead and felt strong throughout.

Cardio adherence was 4/5 days as planned, which I'm satisfied with. My endurance continues to improve—I'm noticing better recovery between interval sets and my resting heart rate seems to be trending down slightly. The 2608 kcal target feels appropriate; I'm never starving but also not overly full. Protein intake at 163g is supporting my training well.

Body composition changes are subtle but positive. Weight is stable with maybe a very slight downward trend, which aligns with my endurance focus. I can feel my cardiovascular capacity improving more than I see dramatic physical changes, which is exactly what I'm after. The 18.4% body fat feels like it's slowly decreasing, though I'm not obsessing over the scale.

Budget came in at 38.7 SAR/day—well within my 40 SAR limit. I'm getting smarter about bulk buying proteins and seasonal vegetables. My intermediate cooking skills are definitely paying off; batch-cooking chicken, rice, and roasted vegetables on Sunday sets me up for success.

Minor challenges: Thursday's sleep deficit created a small energy dip, but I recovered quickly. The meal timing delay didn't derail me. Skipping one cardio session isn't ideal but it's realistic given my life demands. No injuries, no major soreness beyond normal DOMS. Recovery protocols (stretching, adequate sleep, proper nutrition) are working.

Looking ahead, I want to maintain this consistency. The ~78% adherence rate feels sustainable long-term, which is more important than perfection. I'm building habits that stick rather than burning out on an unrealistic program. The endurance adaptations are coming along nicely—I'll continue this trajectory into the next training block."
P13,2025-W52,18,32.9,77.3,2668,7.1,"Week 52 went really well overall. I stuck to the plan pretty consistently, hitting about 79% adherence which is right in my wheelhouse. Started strong Monday with W03 workout - felt energized and the post-workout cardio session was smooth. Tuesday's W07 session pushed me hard but in a good way; my interval recovery times are definitely improving compared to a month ago.

Wednesday I had a work lunch that threw off my meal timing and added about 110 extra calories - nothing major, just a slightly larger portion of rice with the grilled chicken. I adjusted dinner down a bit to compensate. Thursday was my toughest day - only got 6.9 hours of sleep due to a late project deadline, and I felt it during the W11 workout. Pushed through but had to dial back intensity slightly on the final set. Skipped the post-workout cardio that day to prioritize recovery.

Friday bounced back strong with 7.4 hours of sleep and crushed the W15 workout. Energy levels were excellent. Saturday I intentionally took as a full rest day - no cardio session, just active recovery with a 30-minute walk in the evening. My body needed it after Thursday's deficit.

Sunday's W21 workout felt fantastic. I'm noticing real endurance gains - my heart rate recovers faster between sets and I'm maintaining better form throughout. Did the full cardio session post-workout and felt strong. Meal prep Sunday afternoon set me up perfectly for the coming week.

Budget-wise I came in at 39.2 SAR/day, well under my 40 SAR limit. The Sunday meal prep continues to be a game-changer for both adherence and cost control. Weight is holding steady around 77.3kg with subtle improvements in body composition - clothes fitting better, more definition in shoulders and arms. No injuries, soreness is manageable and actually feels productive. Sleep averaged 7.1 hours which is slightly below my target but not concerning given one rough night. Overall feeling strong and motivated heading into the new year."
P13,2026-W01,17.7,33.1,77.1,2689,7.1,"Week 1 of 2026 went pretty well overall. I managed to stick to the plan about 79% of the time, which feels consistent with my usual adherence. Monday kicked off strong with W03 workout—felt good to start the year with solid energy. Tuesday's W07 session was challenging but I pushed through, and the post-workout cardio felt great for endurance building.

Wednesday was a bit rough. Work ran late and I ended up grabbing an extra snack around 9 PM—probably added about 110 kcal over target. Not a disaster, but I noticed I was hungrier than usual, maybe from the increased training load. Thursday was the toughest day: only got 6.9 hours of sleep due to an early meeting, and I felt it during the day. I delayed my lunch by about 75 minutes because of back-to-back calls, which threw off my energy timing. By evening, I decided to skip the post-W11 cardio session to prioritize recovery—my legs were feeling heavy and I didn't want to risk overtraining or injury. That was the right call because Friday I bounced back strong.

Friday's W15 workout was excellent—7.4 hours of sleep the night before made a huge difference. Energy was high, lifts felt crisp, and the cardio session afterward showed clear improvements in my interval recovery times. I'm definitely seeing progress in cardiovascular capacity. Sunday's W21 workout capped off the week nicely, and I did my usual meal prep which set me up perfectly for the coming week.

Saturday was my intentional rest day—just some light stretching and a walk. I'm learning that this active recovery day is crucial for maintaining the 5-day workout schedule without burning out. Budget-wise, I came in at 39.2 SAR per day on average, so comfortably under my 40 SAR limit. Meal prep on Sunday continues to be the MVP strategy—saves money and keeps me on track.

Physically, I'm noticing positive changes. Weight is stable around 77.3 kg, but I can see better muscle definition, especially in my shoulders and core. The mirror test shows I'm leaning out slightly while maintaining strength. No injuries, no major soreness beyond normal DOMS. My resting heart rate seems to be dropping slightly, which is a good endurance marker.

The one area I need to watch is Thursday—that's consistently my weakest day due to work stress and the mid-week fatigue. I might need to adjust my Wednesday evening routine to ensure better sleep going into Thursday. Overall though, I'm really happy with how this week went. The endurance focus is paying off, and I feel like I'm building a sustainable rhythm. Looking forward to Week 2!"
P13,2026-W02,17.4,33.2,76.9,2513,7.1,"Week 2 of 2026 went really well overall. I managed to keep my adherence at around 77% which is close to my target. Monday started strong with W03 workout - felt energized and the interval training was tough but manageable. Tuesday's W07 session pushed my endurance nicely, especially the tempo runs. I did have a slight hiccup on Wednesday when I overshot my calorie target by about 95 kcal due to an unexpected work lunch, but I adjusted Thursday's portions to compensate. Thursday was challenging - only got 6.8 hours of sleep due to a late project deadline, so I felt a bit sluggish during the W11 workout and had to reduce the intensity slightly on the last set. Friday bounced back nicely with 7.3 hours of sleep and crushed the W15 workout. Saturday was my active recovery day with a light 30-minute walk and stretching. Sunday's W21 workout was excellent - I'm definitely seeing improvements in my cardiovascular capacity and recovery between intervals. Meal prep on Sunday evening set me up perfectly for the week ahead. Budget stayed right on track at 39.4 SAR/day average. My energy levels were consistently good except for that Thursday dip. I'm noticing my endurance is improving week over week, and my clothes are fitting a bit better around the waist. The 7.1 hours average sleep is working well for recovery. No injuries or major soreness, just the good kind of muscle fatigue that tells me I'm making progress."
P13,2026-W03,17.2,33.3,76.7,2646,7.1,"Week 3 of 2026 went really well overall. I maintained strong adherence to the nutrition plan at around 76%, which is right in line with my typical pattern. The 2659 kcal target felt appropriate for my endurance training load this week—I completed all 5 planned workouts (W03, W07, W11, W15, W21) without missing a session, which I'm proud of.

Monday's W03 workout felt solid coming off the weekend. Energy was high and I pushed through the intervals with good form. Tuesday's W07 session was more challenging—I could feel some residual fatigue but completed it as prescribed. Wednesday I had a small nutrition slip, going about 90 kcal over target due to an impromptu work lunch, but I didn't stress about it since my adherence propensity allows for these realistic deviations.

Thursday was my toughest day. Sleep dipped to 6.8 hours due to a work deadline, and I definitely felt it during the W11 workout. I had to reduce intensity slightly on the tempo intervals, backing off about 10% on pace to avoid burnout. Friday bounced back nicely—7.3 hours of sleep really helped, and the W15 workout felt strong again. Energy levels were back to normal.

Sunday's W21 workout was excellent. I'm noticing continued improvements in my interval recovery times and my tempo pace is getting more comfortable at higher speeds. My endurance goal is clearly progressing. Body composition feels like it's trending positively too—I can see slightly better muscle definition in my shoulders and legs.

Meal prep on Sunday evening remains my secret weapon. Spending 90 minutes prepping proteins, chopping vegetables, and portioning out my macros for the week makes weekday adherence so much easier. My intermediate cooking skills are definitely paying off. Budget-wise, I averaged 39.2 SAR per day, staying comfortably within my 40 SAR limit. I found good deals on chicken breast and brown rice at the local market.

Saturday was my active recovery day—I did a light 30-minute walk and some mobility work. No structured workout, but keeping the body moving felt right. Recovery overall has been excellent with no injuries or concerning soreness. Just normal training adaptation.

The 7.1 hours average sleep was adequate but I'd like to push closer to 7.5 hours next week. That Thursday dip reminded me how much sleep impacts my performance. Overall, I feel like I'm in a good rhythm with training, nutrition, and recovery. The endurance gains are motivating me to stay consistent."
P13,2026-W04,16.9,33.5,76.4,2687,7,"Week 4 of 2026 went solidly overall. I managed to complete all 5 scheduled workouts (W03, W07, W11, W15, W21) despite some challenges mid-week. Monday and Tuesday felt strong - W03 and W07 were executed at full intensity with good recovery between intervals. Wednesday's W11 session coincided with a particularly stressful work deadline and only 6.9 hours of sleep, so I reduced intensity by about 12% on the harder intervals to avoid burnout. Still got the work done, just dialed back the ego a bit. Thursday's W15 tempo run felt surprisingly good given the week's accumulation, and Saturday's W21 long endurance session was excellent - I'm noticing my aerobic base is really building now, with lower heart rates at the same paces.

Nutrition adherence hovered around 74% this week, slightly below my usual 78% propensity. Monday through Wednesday I nailed the meal prep targets, but Thursday I had an unexpected client dinner that added about 320 extra calories (lots of bread and olive oil at the restaurant). Friday I compensated slightly by being more conservative, and the weekend was back on track. My Sunday meal prep session took about 95 minutes - batch cooked chicken, rice, and roasted vegetables for the week ahead. Budget came in at 39.8 SAR/day average, just under my 40 SAR limit. I had to swap out some premium protein sources mid-week for more economical options (chicken thighs instead of breast, local fish instead of salmon).

Sleep averaged 7.0 hours this week, ranging from 6.7h on Wednesday (work stress kept me up) to 7.4h on Sunday. I'm still targeting that 7.5h average but life happens. Energy levels were good except for Wednesday afternoon when I felt the deficit. Recovery felt adequate - no unusual soreness, and my resting heart rate is stable around 58 bpm. Body composition is visually progressing; I can see more definition in my shoulders and legs, and my pants fit slightly looser around the waist. The scale shows modest progress which aligns with my endurance-focused goals rather than aggressive cutting.

Endurance metrics continue to improve. My tempo pace on W15 was about 8 seconds per km faster than three weeks ago at the same perceived effort. Interval recovery on W11 is getting easier - heart rate drops more quickly between reps. No injuries or concerning niggles, though I'm being careful with my left Achilles which occasionally feels tight after long runs. I'm foam rolling and doing ankle mobility work as preventive maintenance.

Looking ahead, I want to prioritize sleep more consistently - aiming for that 7.5h target will require better evening discipline. Also considering adding a midday protein snack to better distribute intake and support recovery. Overall, feeling strong and on track with the endurance progression."
P13,2026-W05,16.7,33.6,76.2,2565,7,"Week 5 complete and honestly feeling strong overall. Started Monday with W03 (easy run) which felt smooth - legs were fresh from the weekend. Tuesday's W07 tempo session was challenging but I hit the paces, though my left Achilles was a bit tender afterward so I spent extra time foam rolling. Wednesday was the toughest day - only got 6.8 hours sleep due to an early morning meeting, and the W11 workout (intervals) felt harder than usual. I reduced the intensity by about 10% on the last two intervals to avoid pushing too hard on tired legs. Thursday had a work lunch that wasn't planned, added maybe 280 extra calories with the shawarma plate, but I adjusted dinner down slightly. Friday's W15 (long easy run) was excellent - felt like my endurance base is really building. Saturday rest day I used for meal prep, took about 90 minutes. Sunday's W21 (tempo + strides) went well, finished feeling accomplished. Nutrition adherence was around 76% this week - mostly on target except that Thursday lunch and one evening snack. Sleep averaged exactly 7.0 hours, ranging from 6.8 to 7.3. Budget stayed tight at 39.5 SAR/day average. The Achilles is manageable with consistent rolling and stretching. Body feels leaner, energy is good most days except that Wednesday dip. Really noticing the tempo pace improvements - I'm holding faster speeds with less perceived effort. Next week I want to focus on getting that sleep up to 7.5 hours consistently and maybe add a midday protein snack on workout days to support recovery better."
P13,2026-W06,16.4,33.7,75.9,2545,7,"Week 6 felt like a strong continuation of the endurance base building phase. Started the week with good energy following Sunday's meal prep, which made nutrition adherence much easier. Monday's W03 workout felt smooth - recovery intervals are definitely getting easier and I'm holding tempo pace longer without the same cardiovascular strain. Tuesday was a rest day that I used for active recovery and foam rolling, paying special attention to the left Achilles which continues to feel stable.

Wednesday brought the familiar mid-week challenge with an early client presentation that cut my sleep to 6.7 hours. W07 still got done but I could feel the fatigue in my legs during the intervals. Reduced intensity by about 8% on the harder sets to avoid overreaching. Thursday's nutrition took a hit with an unexpected team lunch - estimated about 250 kcal over target but I adjusted dinner portions to partially compensate.

Friday's W11 was surprisingly strong despite Wednesday's deficit. Sleep bounced back to 7.2 hours and my legs felt recovered. The tempo sections felt controlled and powerful. Saturday's W15 continued the positive trend - endurance is clearly building as the longer efforts feel more sustainable. Sunday's W21 was challenging but manageable, and I'm noticing improved mental resilience during the harder intervals.

Achilles monitoring continues daily - mild awareness post-Saturday but nothing concerning. Foam rolling and stretching protocol maintained throughout the week. Body composition changes are becoming more visible, particularly in the midsection where definition is improving. Energy levels were solid 6 out of 7 days with only Wednesday showing the expected dip.

Meal prep on Sunday took about 85 minutes and set me up well for the week. Budget tracking came in at 39.2 SAR/day average, leaving a small buffer. Overall adherence felt strong at around 77-78%, with the Thursday lunch being the main deviation. Hydration stayed consistent at 2.5-3L daily. Looking forward to continuing this progression into Week 7."
P13,2026-W07,16.2,33.8,75.6,2612,7.1,"Week 7 felt like a natural continuation of the momentum from Week 6, though I definitely noticed some mid-week fatigue that required careful management. Monday started strong with W03 completed at full intensity - legs felt fresh and the tempo intervals were controlled. Tuesday's nutrition was spot-on with meal prep carrying over well. Wednesday's W07 session was challenging; I woke up with only 6.8 hours of sleep due to a late work call, and during the workout I could feel the deficit in my recovery between intervals. I made the smart call to reduce intensity by about 6-7% rather than push through and risk the Achilles flaring up. Thursday brought an unexpected client dinner that pushed my budget to 44 SAR and added roughly 280 extra calories - the restaurant options were limited and I couldn't hit my macro targets precisely. I compensated Friday morning with a lighter breakfast and nailed the W11 workout with excellent form. The weekend was solid: W15 on Saturday felt controlled and strong, with the Achilles showing only minimal awareness that resolved with my usual foam rolling protocol. Sunday's W21 long endurance session was a highlight - I maintained consistent pacing throughout and felt mentally sharp even in the final third. Meal prep Sunday took 95 minutes as I experimented with a new quinoa bowl recipe that will save time next week. Overall adherence was around 76% - slightly down from Week 6 due to Thursday's dinner and one missed snack on Wednesday when meetings ran long. Sleep averaged 7.1 hours with better weekend recovery. Body composition continues trending positively; I'm noticing improved definition in my obliques and my morning weight is stabilizing in the 75.5-75.7 kg range. Energy levels were good on 5 out of 7 days, with Wednesday and Thursday being the exceptions. Hydration stayed consistent at 2.7-3.1L daily. The endurance base is definitely building - I'm recovering faster between interval sets and my resting heart rate is down slightly. No injuries or concerning issues. Looking ahead to Week 8, I want to tighten up the nutrition adherence back above 80% and protect that Wednesday sleep window better."
P13,2026-W08,16,33.9,75.4,2547,7,"Week 8 felt solid overall with 4 out of 5 planned workouts completed. Monday's tempo run (W03) went smoothly with good pace control—definitely feeling the endurance improvements from previous weeks. Tuesday's intervals (W07) were challenging but manageable; my recovery between reps is noticeably faster now. Wednesday I had to skip W11 due to work commitments running late and only getting 6.9h sleep the night before—I made the call to prioritize recovery rather than push through fatigue. Thursday's long run (W15) was excellent; felt strong throughout and the left Achilles had zero issues. Friday's strength session (W21) completed all sets with good form.

Nutrition adherence was approximately 74% this week—slightly below my typical range. Monday and Tuesday were spot-on with meal prep from Sunday. Wednesday's skipped workout meant I adjusted calories down slightly (about 2420 kcal) to avoid surplus. Thursday I had a work lunch that pushed me about 320 kcal over target, hitting roughly 2890 kcal and costing 46 SAR for the day. Friday I compensated by keeping it lean at around 2480 kcal. Weekend was solid with good meal prep discipline.

Sleep averaged 7.0 hours this week—slightly down from last week's 7.1h. Wednesday's 6.9h and Thursday's 6.8h were the low points, likely contributing to the missed workout and the slightly lower energy mid-week. Weekend sleep bounced back to 7.3-7.4h which helped recovery.

Budget came in at 41.2 SAR/day average, again slightly over the 40 SAR target primarily due to Thursday's unplanned lunch. I'm noticing a pattern with these client/work meals—need to build in more buffer or make strategic substitutions earlier in the week.

Body composition continues trending positively. Morning weight stable in the 75.4-75.6 kg range. Visually, core definition is improving and I'm feeling leaner despite stable scale weight, suggesting continued favorable recomposition. RHR continues its downward trend—measured 56 bpm on Sunday morning, down from typical 58-59 a few weeks ago.

Hydration was good at 2.8-3.2L daily. Energy levels were high on workout days (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday) but noticeably lower Wednesday and Thursday morning, correlating with the sleep dips. No injuries or significant soreness beyond normal training adaptation.

The missed Wednesday workout is a reminder that my 78% adherence propensity is realistic—life happens, and I'm learning to make smart recovery calls rather than forcing sessions when conditions aren't right. Overall, Week 8 represents continued progress on the endurance goal with minor adherence adjustments needed around budget and maintaining that 7.1h+ sleep average."
P13,2026-W09,15.7,34.1,75.3,2548,7.1,"Week 9 complete and honestly feeling proud of the consistency despite some real challenges. Started strong Monday with W03—tempo run felt controlled, RHR holding at 56 bpm which shows the aerobic base is still building. Tuesday's W07 intervals were tough but recovery between sets was noticeably faster than a month ago. Wednesday hit the wall—work ran late again (seems to be a pattern mid-week) and only got 6.7 hours sleep. Made the smart call to skip W11 rather than push through fatigued, learned that lesson last week. Thursday bounced back with W15, legs felt fresh from the rest day. Friday's W21 long run was excellent, maintained pace throughout and energy was high.

Nutrition was better this week—planned ahead for the Thursday work lunch and kept it to +180 kcal over target instead of the +320 disaster from Week 8. Brought my own sides which helped. Overall adherence around 76%, slight improvement. Budget averaged 40.8 SAR/day, much better control than last week's 41.2. The meal prep Sunday evening made a huge difference for Monday-Wednesday.

Sleep averaged 7.1 hours (range 6.7-7.5h), still not perfect but the Wednesday dip didn't cascade like before. Energy levels were good 6 out of 7 days. Hydration consistent at 3.0-3.3L daily. Left Achilles remains completely asymptomatic—the gradual volume increase approach is working.

Body feels different this week—not lighter necessarily, but tighter around the core and shoulders. Clothes fitting slightly better. The recomposition is real even if scale doesn't show dramatic changes. Recovery quality improving, morning stiffness minimal.

Completed 4/5 workouts again but it was a strategic decision, not fatigue-induced failure. The pattern is clear: I need better Wednesday planning or accept that 4 quality sessions beats 5 compromised ones. Endurance metrics all trending positive—pace consistency up, HR recovery faster, mental stamina during long runs stronger. Ready for Week 10."
P13,2026-W10,15.2,34.2,74.8,2380,7,"Completed the first week with solid adherence around 78%. The meal plan was enjoyable and culturally familiar, which made it easier to stick to. Ful Medames for breakfast kept me full, and the shawarma lunches were convenient. The advanced gym workouts were challenging but manageable given my intermediate fitness level. I missed about 1 workout this week due to work commitments. The calorie target felt appropriate for endurance training, though I found myself slightly under target on 2 days when I had to skip the baklava dessert. Energy levels were good during cardio sessions, and recovery between strength days was adequate. Sleep remained consistent around 7 hours. Looking forward to continuing, though I may need to adjust portion sizes slightly as I adapt."
P13,2026-W11,14.9,34.4,75.1,2070,7,"Completed the first week with solid adherence around 78%. The diet plan was manageable with my intermediate cooking skills, and the meals fit well within my budget. The hummus and khubz breakfast became a favorite, though I occasionally reduced portions on the Mafrouka due to its richness. Training sessions were intense but appropriate for my intermediate fitness level transitioning to advanced workouts. The 5-day split targeting different muscle groups felt well-structured. Energy levels were good throughout the week, especially on workout days. The endurance-focused approach with adequate carbs supported my training volume well. Sleep remained consistent at 7 hours. Minor muscle soreness mid-week from the advanced programming, but recovery was adequate. Overall, a strong start to the program."
P13,2026-W12,14.3,34.6,74.7,2680,7,"Overall solid week! I managed to stick to the meal plan about 78% of the time - the foul medames breakfast became my favorite, really kept me energized through morning workouts. Had to swap the chicken tagine for grilled chicken twice due to time constraints, but kept the macros similar. The advanced gym workouts were challenging but appropriate for my intermediate-to-advanced level. Chest and back days were particularly intense. I noticed improved stamina during my cardio warm-ups, which aligns with my endurance goal. The 2735 kcal target felt right - never starving, never overly full. Greek yogurt snack was perfect post-workout. Only struggled with the couscous meal once when I ate out with colleagues and had kabsa instead. Sleep remained consistent at 7 hours. Energy levels were high throughout the week, and recovery between sessions felt good."
P13,2026-W13,13.8,34.7,74.2,2720,6.9,"Completed the first week with solid adherence around 78%. The advanced gym workouts were challenging but manageable given my intermediate fitness level. I managed to hit the gym all 5 scheduled days, though some sessions were slightly shorter than planned. The diet plan was interesting - the total daily calories seemed low at around 2600 kcal, which created a moderate deficit. I felt hungry occasionally, especially mid-afternoon, but the meal timing worked well around my training schedule. The Shakshuka breakfast was filling and the Chicken Mandi lunch provided good energy for afternoon workouts. Recovery felt adequate with 7 hours of sleep most nights. I noticed improved endurance during cardio warm-ups and slightly better stamina in the final sets of exercises. Energy levels were consistent throughout the week, though I experienced minor fatigue on day 6. The advanced workout split hit all major muscle groups effectively. Overall, a strong start to the program."
P13,2026-W14,13.5,34.9,74.5,2650,7,"Solid first week overall. I managed to stick to the meal plan about 75-80% of the time, which I'm happy with given my work schedule. The Ful Medames breakfast was filling and kept me energized through morning meetings. I did swap the dates snack for protein bars twice when I was rushing between appointments. The gym workouts were challenging but appropriate for my level - the advanced programs really pushed me, especially the leg day. I felt the volume was high but manageable with 5 sessions. Recovery was decent though I noticed some fatigue by Friday. The endurance focus is showing early signs - my rest periods between sets decreased slightly and I felt less winded during compound movements. Meal prep on weekends helped a lot with adherence during weekdays. The calorie target felt right - not too hungry, not overly full. I did have one business dinner where I went off-plan (estimated +400 kcal that day). Sleep remained consistent around 7 hours, tried to prioritize it but work demands kept it from improving much."
P13,2026-W15,13.2,35,74.1,2580,7,"Solid first week on the plan. I managed to stick to the diet about 78% of the time - the meals were tasty and filling, especially the Kabsa which became a favorite. The Murtabak in the morning gave me great energy for my workouts. I did skip the hummus snack twice when work got hectic and substituted with protein bars instead. The 5-day advanced gym split was challenging but manageable at my intermediate-to-advanced level. Chest and leg days were particularly intense. I noticed better endurance during my sessions by day 5, especially on back day. Recovery was good with 7 hours of sleep most nights. My energy levels stayed high throughout the week, and I felt less fatigued during cardio finishers. The high carb intake (305g) really supported my endurance training goals.

I managed to stick to the meal plan about 80% of the time - the shakshuka breakfasts were excellent and the lamb kebabs hit the spot after heavy training days. Had to skip the dates and nuts snack twice when work meetings ran long, and I substituted chicken breast for lamb once due to availability. The advanced gym workouts were challenging but manageable given my intermediate fitness level - I had to reduce weight on some shoulder exercises by about 10-15% to maintain proper form.

P14,2025-W47,24.6,22.05,60.7,2210,7.1,"Week 47 was a solid week overall! I managed to stick to the meal plan about 80% of the time, which I'm happy with given my usual 75% adherence. The 2148 kcal target felt appropriate most days, though I did notice I was genuinely hungrier on Wednesday and Friday after the more intense workouts (W25 - the full body strength sessions). I added an extra snack on those days - usually some extra fruit and a small handful of almonds - which probably pushed me slightly over target but felt necessary for recovery.

All four workouts completed as scheduled! Monday and Thursday were the W25 sessions (full body compound movements), and Tuesday and Saturday were W21 (upper body focused with some cardio). The leg work on Monday left me properly sore until Wednesday, but in that good 'I actually worked hard' way. By Thursday's session, I felt strong again. The W21 sessions felt more manageable and I enjoyed the variety.

Sleep averaged around 7 hours, which is my baseline. I did get closer to 7.5 hours on Tuesday and Friday nights, possibly because of workout fatigue. Energy levels were consistently good throughout the week - no afternoon crashes, and I felt mentally sharp at work.

The lactose-free laban continues to work well for me, no digestive issues at all. I made a few minor substitutions: swapped chicken for turkey once, used brown rice instead of white rice twice, and had regular yogurt instead of Greek yogurt one morning (budget-friendly choice when I saw it on sale). My cooking skills definitely helped - meal prep on Sunday took about 2 hours and made the weekdays much easier.

Budget-wise, I stayed comfortably within my 50 SAR/day allocation. I spent about 320 SAR for the week, leaving me some buffer. Shopping at the local market for produce and buying chicken in bulk helped keep costs down.

One observation: I think my body is responding well to this recomp approach. I feel slightly leaner around my midsection, and my clothes fit a bit better. The scale hasn't moved dramatically, but I can see subtle changes in the mirror - a bit more definition in my shoulders and legs. The combination of adequate protein (134g daily) and progressive resistance training seems to be working.

Minor challenges: Thursday morning I woke up feeling a bit stiff from Monday's leg session lingering, but a good warm-up sorted that out. Saturday's workout was scheduled for morning but I had to shift it to afternoon due to a family commitment - still got it done though!

Looking ahead, I might experiment with slightly increasing calories on heavy training days (maybe 100-150 kcal more) to see if that helps with recovery and performance. Overall though, very pleased with this week. The plan is sustainable, fits my lifestyle and budget, and I'm seeing the gradual progress I'm after."
P14,2025-W48,24.1,22.25,60.4,2183,7,"Week 48 complete! This was a solid week overall. Started Monday strong with W25 (upper body strength), felt powerful and managed all sets with good form. Tuesday's W21 (HIIT cardio) was tough but energizing - my conditioning is definitely improving. Hit W25 again Thursday and noticed I could push slightly heavier on some movements. Friday's W21 session had me sweating buckets but I powered through.

Diet-wise, I stuck pretty close to the 2185 kcal target most days. Monday and Wednesday I was spot-on around 2200 kcal. Tuesday I went slightly under at about 2050 kcal - wasn't as hungry post-HIIT. Thursday was a training day so I bumped up to around 2280 kcal with an extra serving of rice and chicken at dinner. Friday I was back to 2150 kcal. Weekend was interesting - Saturday I had a social lunch that pushed me to about 2350 kcal (still tracked everything, just had some extra hummus and pita), and Sunday I compensated slightly at 2100 kcal.

Protein targets were consistently met - averaging 135-140g daily. I've been meal prepping on Sundays which helps enormously. My go-to meals were grilled chicken with quinoa and roasted vegetables, Greek yogurt with berries for snacks, and egg white omelets for breakfast. Made a really good lentil and vegetable stew mid-week that was budget-friendly and hit my fiber goals perfectly.

Energy levels were great throughout. Sleep averaged around 7 hours per night - would love to get closer to 7.5 but work commitments made that challenging. Recovery felt good between sessions. No unusual soreness, just that satisfying post-workout feeling.

Physically, I'm noticing my clothes fitting differently - pants are looser in the waist but tighter in the thighs (in a good way!). Shoulders look more defined and I can see some ab definition emerging. The scale moved down slightly but I know I'm building muscle so I'm not fixated on that number.

Budget came in at approximately 315 SAR for the week - well within my 350 SAR weekly allowance. Shopping at the local market for vegetables and buying chicken in bulk really helps. Spent about 45 SAR/day average.

Challenges: Wednesday evening I was tempted to skip the gym due to work stress but reminded myself of my goals and went anyway - so glad I did! Also had a craving for sweets on Saturday but satisfied it with some dates and dark chocolate (tracked it all).

Overall feeling: Strong, capable, and motivated. The recomposition is happening - I can feel it and see it. Ready to keep this momentum going into next week!"
P14,2025-W49,23.8,22.4,60.2,2065,6.9,"Week 49 was a solid continuation of my recomposition journey! I managed to stick to my plan pretty well despite some unexpected work stress mid-week. Started strong on Monday with W25 (upper body strength) - felt powerful and hit all my sets. Tuesday's nutrition was spot-on, meal prep from Sunday really paid off. Wednesday brought W21 (lower body) and I could feel my quads getting stronger, though I did have to cut the cool-down short due to a work call. Thursday I deviated slightly on calories (around 2280 kcal) because of a lunch meeting with a client - chose grilled fish and vegetables but the portion was larger than planned. Friday's W25 session felt a bit sluggish, probably because I only got 6.5 hours of sleep Thursday night due to project deadlines. Saturday was my rest day and I meal prepped again, staying within budget at the local market. Sunday's W21 workout was excellent - really focused on form and felt the mind-muscle connection. Overall energy was good, recovery between sessions felt adequate. I noticed my clothes fitting differently around the waist and shoulders, which is motivating! Budget came in at 310 SAR for the week (44.3 SAR/day average), leaving me some buffer. The only real challenge was managing sleep with work demands - averaged 6.9 hours which is slightly below my usual 7. No injuries, no major cravings, and I'm feeling confident going into next week."
P14,2025-W50,23.2,22.6,59.8,1720,6.9,"Week 2025-W50 Complete - Solid Progress with Minor Challenges

This week presented a realistic mix of successes and obstacles. Started strong on Monday with W25 (upper body strength) feeling energized despite the 537 kcal daily target seeming quite restrictive - I quickly realized this must be a per-meal target, not daily, so I aimed for approximately 1600-1800 kcal total daily for recomposition.

Day 1-2: Excellent adherence. Meal prep on Sunday paid off. Hit workouts with good intensity. The 66g carbs per meal gave me adequate energy for training. Sleep at 7.1 hours felt restorative.

Day 3-4: Wednesday's W21 (lower body HIIT) was challenging after a rough night (5.8 hours sleep due to work stress). Felt the fatigue but pushed through at about 80% intensity. Thursday was a rest day where I indulged slightly - went 150 kcal over target at a colleague's dinner but made smart protein-forward choices. My 75% adherence propensity showed here - I enjoyed the social aspect without derailing completely.

Day 5-6: Friday's W25 session felt strong again. Recovery improving. Saturday's W21 was excellent - felt powerful and noticed visible shoulder definition in the mirror post-workout. This recomposition approach is working! The intermediate cooking skills helped me create satisfying meals within my 50 SAR daily budget (averaging 45-48 SAR most days).

Day 7: Active recovery with walking. Reflected on the week feeling accomplished.

Challenges: Mid-week sleep dip affected energy. The restrictive feeling early week until I clarified caloric needs. One minor digestive issue on Thursday (possibly from the social meal's richer preparation).

Wins: All 4 planned workouts completed! Protein targets consistently met (averaging 128g daily). Body composition visibly improving - clothes fitting differently around waist and shoulders. Mental state remains highly positive. Budget management effortless with meal planning.

Physical changes: Slight scale weight reduction but this masks the real story - muscle feels fuller and denser, particularly in quads and delts. Waist measurements down approximately 0.5cm. The recomposition goal is manifesting exactly as hoped. Energy levels high except that one poor sleep night.

Looking forward: Ready to continue this momentum. Considering slightly increasing carbs around lower body days for better performance. Overall, this is sustainable and producing results."
P14,2025-W51,22.9,22.8,59.5,1733,6.8,"Week 51 has been a solid continuation of my recomposition journey, though I definitely felt the cumulative fatigue from maintaining this pace. Started the week energized after last week's visible progress, which kept my motivation high even when things got challenging.

Monday and Tuesday were fantastic - hit both workouts at close to 95% intensity, meals were prepped and on point, and I felt strong. The W25 full-body session Monday really pushed my limits with the compound movements, and I could feel my muscles responding well. Recovery nutrition was dialed in with my usual protein timing.

Wednesday brought the first challenge - work ran late and I only managed 6.2 hours of sleep. I still completed the W21 upper body workout but definitely felt it was harder to maintain form on the last sets. Dropped to about 80% intensity but pushed through. Nutrition stayed clean at around 1695 kcal, slightly under target but my appetite was suppressed from fatigue.

Thursday was my rest day and I used it well - caught up on sleep with 7.4 hours and meal prepped for the weekend. Had a small craving for something sweet in the evening and indulged in some dates with almond butter, which pushed me to about 1820 kcal. Not ideal but within reason and I don't feel guilty about it.

Friday's W25 workout was challenging. My legs felt heavy from Monday's session, and I had to really focus on mind-muscle connection. Completed all sets but probably at 85% intensity. The good news is my protein intake was spot-on at 136g, and I'm noticing my shoulders and arms looking more defined even when not pumped.

Weekend was a mixed bag. Saturday's W21 workout went surprisingly well - sometimes that extra rest day really helps. Hit about 90% intensity and felt powerful. However, I had a family gathering Saturday evening which meant eating out. I made smart choices - grilled chicken, salad, and a small portion of rice - but the restaurant portions and cooking oil definitely added hidden calories. Estimated around 1880 kcal for the day.

Sunday was active recovery - went for a long walk and did some stretching. Kept calories moderate at 1650 and focused on hydration. My body feels like it's adapting well to this training volume, though I can tell I'm walking a fine line with recovery given my sleep averaging just under 7 hours.

The scale shows a small drop, but more importantly, my measurements are changing - waist is slightly smaller and my clothes fit differently around the shoulders and arms. The mirror shows more definition in my abs and my quads are starting to show separation. This is exactly the recomposition effect I'm working toward.

Budget-wise, I averaged about 46 SAR daily. Meal prep continues to be my best friend - bulk buying chicken breast, eggs, oats, and vegetables keeps costs down. The family meal out Saturday was my only splurge at around 65 SAR, but I balanced it by keeping other days lean.

Challenges this week: Sleep consistency remains my biggest barrier. The 5.8-hour night Wednesday really impacted my Thursday energy levels. I need to be more disciplined about my evening routine and screen time before bed. Also, managing social situations while staying on track requires constant vigilance and planning ahead.

Wins: Completed all 4 planned workouts despite fatigue. Protein intake was consistent (averaged 131g). Managed a social meal without completely derailing progress. Visible physical changes continuing. Mental resilience is building - I'm learning to push through the hard days.

Looking ahead: I need to prioritize sleep more intentionally. Maybe I'll try a magnesium supplement before bed to improve sleep quality. Also considering adjusting my training split slightly if recovery becomes an issue - possibly adding one more rest day and doing 3 intense sessions rather than 4 moderate-to-high intensity sessions. But for now, the current approach is working and I'm seeing results, so I'll maintain course while monitoring recovery markers closely.

Overall adherence this week: approximately 76% - slightly lower than my 78% last week due to the social meal and one subpar workout, but still well within my typical range. I'm proud of the consistency and the discipline I'm showing, especially managing this alongside work and life responsibilities."
P14,2025-W52,22.3,23.1,59.2,1755,6.7,"This week was a solid continuation of my recomposition journey, though I definitely felt the cumulative fatigue catching up with me. Started strong on Monday with W25 feeling powerful - my shoulder definition is really coming through now and I noticed more separation in my delts during overhead presses. Tuesday's W21 was good cardio work, kept my heart rate elevated and felt the metabolic boost.

Wednesday was rough - only got 5.9 hours of sleep due to work stress and a late project deadline. I pushed through W25 but had to drop intensity to about 75% on the heavier compound movements. My body was clearly asking for rest. Listened to it Thursday and got 7.6 hours which made a huge difference. Friday's W21 felt much better, back to 85% intensity.

Nutrition-wise, I'm getting better at meal prep efficiency. Averaged around 1755 kcal daily which is slightly below target but I wasn't forcing food when not hungry. Protein stayed consistent at 128g average - my go-to chicken and lentil combinations are working well within budget. Spent about 48 SAR daily on average, with one splurge on fresh salmon (62 SAR) which was worth it for the omega-3s and mental satisfaction.

The social aspect was easier this week - one small family gathering on Saturday where I had reasonable portions and tracked loosely, estimating about 200 kcal over target. No guilt, just adjusted Sunday slightly.

Physically, I'm seeing continued changes. My jeans fit looser around the waist but tighter in the thighs - exactly what I'm aiming for. Core definition is improving, especially visible in morning light. The scale moved slightly down but I know I'm gaining muscle based on performance improvements and visual changes.

The fatigue concern is real though. Six workouts over two weeks at this intensity with suboptimal sleep is starting to show. I felt it in my recovery time and general energy levels mid-week. I'm planning to prioritize sleep next week - maybe shifting my evening routine earlier and limiting screen time after 9 PM. Considering if I should do a deload week soon or just maintain current volume with slightly lower intensity.

Mental state is still motivated but I'm being more realistic about recovery needs. No injuries, which is the priority. Some minor DOMS in glutes and hamstrings after Wednesday's session that lingered until Friday, but manageable. Overall adherence around 73% this week when accounting for the intensity drop and slight caloric deficit.

Proud of: Consistency despite fatigue, staying within budget, visible progress continuing.
Work on: Sleep quality and duration, maybe add a 10-minute evening stretching routine, consider magnesium supplementation for recovery."
P14,2026-W01,22,23.2,59,1820,6.8,"Week 1 of 2026 started with strong intentions but reality hit hard. Monday's W25 workout felt solid despite the holiday weekend - managed 85% intensity and felt the pump in shoulders and legs. Tuesday was rest day and I meal prepped which helped massively with staying on track. Wednesday's W21 session was tough; only got 6.2 hours sleep and felt it during the compound movements. Had to drop weight slightly on squats but pushed through.

Thursday I woke up genuinely fatigued - that cumulative tiredness I mentioned last week is real. Skipped the planned W25 workout and did 20 minutes of light stretching instead. Felt guilty but also knew forcing it would be counterproductive. Friday was better after catching up on sleep (7.4 hours!) and nailed the W21 workout at about 80% intensity. The extra rest day actually helped.

Weekend was mixed - Saturday had a family gathering and I went about 300 kcal over target, but it was mostly protein-heavy foods so not terrible. Sunday felt strong, good energy, and I can see the recomposition continuing in the mirror. Waist is definitely tighter and my arms look more defined.

Calorie-wise, I averaged around 1820 kcal/day instead of the 2097 target. I know I'm supposed to eat more but honestly some days I'm just not hungry enough, especially on rest days. Protein stayed decent at around 125g average. Budget was fine - averaged 47 SAR daily, well within limits.

The sleep issue is my biggest concern. Averaged 6.8 hours which is barely better than last week. I really need to prioritize getting to bed earlier, especially before workout days. I've set a new phone alarm for 22:30 as a 'start winding down' reminder.

Overall adherence was probably around 70% - completed 3 out of 4 scheduled workouts, hit protein targets most days, but fell short on total calories and sleep could be better. The visible progress keeps me motivated though. I can feel I'm getting stronger even if the scale isn't moving much. Next week I'm going to focus on sleep quality and maybe add a few more calorie-dense snacks to hit my targets without feeling overstuffed."
P14,2026-W02,21.6,23.4,59.1,1950,6.9,"Week 2 of 2026 was challenging but productive overall. I managed to complete 3 out of 4 scheduled workouts, which I'm pleased with given my work schedule and the accumulated fatigue from last week. Monday's W25 session felt strong - I pushed through with about 85% intensity and really felt the progressive overload kicking in. Wednesday's W21 workout was solid too, though I noticed my legs were still recovering from Monday.

Thursday was the planned W25 day, but I made the conscious decision to skip it. My sleep Tuesday night was only 6.2 hours due to a work deadline, and I could feel the fatigue in my body. Rather than push through and risk injury or burnout, I opted for a 30-minute walk instead and focused on meal prep. This felt like the right call - I'm learning to listen to my body better.

Saturday's W21 session was excellent. The extra rest day helped me come back stronger, and I hit about 90% intensity. I'm seeing visible changes in my shoulders and arms, which is incredibly motivating for my recomposition goals.

Nutrition-wise, I averaged around 1,950 kcal daily, which is still below my 2,132 target, but closer than last week. I'm struggling to hit the full calorie target without going over budget - I've been averaging 48 SAR/day. Protein intake was good at around 128g daily. I had a social brunch on Sunday that added about 250 extra calories, but I planned for it and enjoyed it guilt-free.

Sleep remains my biggest challenge. I averaged 6.9 hours this week, which is a slight improvement, but I know I need 7.5+ hours for optimal recovery and recomposition. I've started setting a phone alarm for 10 PM to begin my wind-down routine, and it's helping somewhat. Weekend sleep was better (7.5 hours both nights), but weeknights are still tough.

The visible recomposition progress is keeping me motivated. My clothes fit differently, especially around my waist and shoulders. I feel stronger in daily activities. The scale hasn't moved much, which is expected with recomp, but I can see and feel the changes. I'm learning that strategic rest is as important as pushing hard, and I'm proud of making that Thursday decision. Moving forward, I want to focus on getting that extra 30 minutes of sleep on weeknights and maybe experimenting with some higher-calorie, budget-friendly foods to hit my targets better."
P14,2026-W03,21.4,23.5,59,1920,6.8,"Week 3 of 2026 was a mixed bag but overall felt productive. I managed to complete 3 out of 4 planned workouts (75% adherence again), which aligns with my typical pattern. Monday's W25 session felt strong—I hit 90% intensity and felt energized despite starting the week. Wednesday's W21 workout was solid, around 85% intensity, though I noticed some lingering fatigue in my legs from Monday. I had to skip Thursday's W25 because I only got 6.1 hours of sleep Wednesday night due to a work deadline, and I've learned from past experience that pushing through on inadequate sleep just leads to poor form and potential injury. Instead, I did a 25-minute walk during lunch. Saturday's W21 session was good—felt recovered and strong, probably 88% intensity.

Sleep averaged 6.8 hours this week, slightly down from my recent 6.9-hour average. Weeknights were tough (6.3-6.5 hours), but I managed 7.6 hours on Saturday night which helped. My 10 PM wind-down alarm worked 4 out of 7 nights—the other nights I got caught up in work or household tasks. I need to be more disciplined about this.

Nutrition was challenging this week. I averaged about 1,920 kcal/day (95% of my 2,011 target), which is better than last week but still slightly under. Protein intake was around 122g/day (97% of target), so pretty close. The main issue was finding calorie-dense options within my 50 SAR/day budget. I experimented with adding more olive oil to my meals and including a handful of mixed nuts as snacks, which helped. I also had a social dinner on Friday that pushed me about 200 kcal over target that day, but I adjusted Saturday to compensate.

Budget-wise, I spent an average of 49 SAR/day, just under my limit. I bought chicken in bulk on sale which saved money, and I'm getting better at meal prepping on Sundays. The challenge is balancing cost with calorie density—lean proteins are affordable but don't add many calories, while calorie-dense foods like nuts and quality oils eat into the budget quickly.

Physically, I'm noticing continued recomposition. My jeans are looser in the waist but tighter in the thighs (in a good way). My shoulders look more defined, especially after upper body days. Weight is stable, which is expected for recomp. Energy levels are good on days with 7+ hours of sleep, but I really feel the difference on 6-hour nights.

For next week, I'm committing to getting to bed by 10:15 PM at least 5 nights to hit 7+ hours more consistently. I'll also try adding tahini to my meals—it's calorie-dense, affordable, and fits my cooking style. Overall, I'm pleased with the consistency and the visible changes, even if the numbers aren't moving dramatically."
P14,2026-W04,21.2,23.6,59.1,2045,6.9,"This week felt like a continuation of my recomp journey with some definite wins and a couple of stumbles. I managed to complete 3 out of 4 scheduled workouts (75% adherence), which matches my typical pattern. Monday's W25 session was solid—I felt strong and pushed through despite starting the week a bit tired. Wednesday's W21 went well, though I could feel the accumulated fatigue from poor weeknight sleep. I had to skip Thursday's W25 because I only got 5.9 hours of sleep Wednesday night and had back-to-back meetings at work that drained me mentally. I made the conscious choice to prioritize recovery over forcing a subpar workout. Saturday's W21 was excellent—I had more energy after sleeping 7.8 hours Friday night, and I really felt the mind-muscle connection during the strength portions.

On the nutrition front, I averaged about 2,045 kcal per day (96% of my 2,132 target), which I'm happy with. I successfully incorporated tahini into my meals this week—mixed it into my yogurt parfaits and made a tahini-lemon dressing for salads. It's a game-changer for hitting calorie targets without feeling overly full. Protein averaged 128g daily (96% of target), which is consistent. I had another social dinner on Friday (a colleague's birthday), which added about 250 extra calories, but I adjusted Saturday's portions slightly and it balanced out. My budget held steady at 48.5 SAR/day, comfortably within my 50 SAR limit.

Sleep remains my biggest challenge. I averaged 6.9 hours this week—slightly better than last week's 6.8, but still not where I need to be. I managed to hit my 10:15 PM wind-down alarm 5 out of 7 nights, which is an improvement. The two nights I missed (Tuesday and Wednesday) were due to finishing work tasks that bled into the evening. I'm noticing a clear pattern: when I get 7+ hours of sleep, my workouts are significantly better and my recovery feels faster.

Physically, I'm continuing to see positive changes. My jeans are noticeably looser around the waist, and I can see more definition in my shoulders and upper back when I look in the mirror. My weight stayed essentially stable (expected for recomp), but the visual changes and how my clothes fit tell the real story. No soreness beyond normal DOMS, and my knee (which sometimes acts up) felt fine all week.

For next week, I'm committing to the 10:15 PM alarm every single night and setting a hard stop on work at 9:30 PM. I'll also continue with the tahini strategy and maybe experiment with adding a small evening snack on workout days to help with recovery. Overall, I feel like I'm building sustainable habits and seeing real progress, even if the scale isn't moving much."
P14,2026-W05,20.9,23.8,59,2098,6.8,"Week 5 complete! This was a challenging week with work demands picking up again, but I'm proud of how I managed to maintain consistency despite some obstacles. Monday's W25 session felt strong - I hit 90% intensity and really felt the progressive overload kicking in. My shoulders are visibly more defined now, which is incredibly motivating.

Wednesday's W21 was solid at 85% intensity, though I could feel the cumulative fatigue from only averaging 6.4 hours of sleep on weeknights. I did skip Thursday's scheduled W25 workout - my sleep Tuesday night was only 6.1 hours and I had back-to-back meetings until 8 PM. Rather than push through exhausted, I honored my recovery-first approach and rested. This felt like the right call because Saturday's W21 session was excellent at 92% intensity.

Sleep was my biggest struggle this week. I managed the 10:15 PM wind-down alarm only 4 out of 7 nights. Tuesday and Thursday were work overflow nights where I couldn't stop until 10 PM, and Friday I got caught up in a phone call with family. Weekend sleep was better - 7.6 hours Friday night and 7.9 hours Saturday night really helped me recover.

Nutrition was on point! I averaged 2,098 kcal daily (99% of target) and hit 131g protein daily (98% of target). The tahini strategy continues to work beautifully for calorie density. I'm getting better at meal prep efficiency - Sunday's batch cooking took only 90 minutes this week. Budget came in at 49.2 SAR/day, just under my limit.

I had a social dinner on Friday (chicken shawarma plate with hummus) that added about 280 extra calories, but I adjusted Saturday's portions slightly and it balanced out perfectly. My body composition changes are becoming more obvious - my pants fit looser around the waist but tighter in the thighs (in a good way!). A colleague even commented that I look 'more athletic' which was a nice confidence boost.

The recomp process is working exactly as expected. Weight staying stable while body composition shifts. No injuries, no unusual soreness beyond normal DOMS. My recovery feels good when I get adequate sleep.

For next week, I'm committing to a hard 9:45 PM work cutoff on weeknights - no exceptions. I'll set a phone alarm that forces me to close my laptop. I'm also going to try adding a small post-workout snack (maybe Greek yogurt with berries) on workout evenings to see if that helps with recovery and sleep quality. The visible progress is keeping me motivated, and I feel like I'm finally finding a sustainable rhythm with this program."
P14,2026-W06,20.5,24.1,59.1,2105,7.1,"Week 6 complete! I managed to hit all 4 workouts this week, which feels like a real win after last week's Thursday skip. The 9:45 PM work cutoff alarm I set was a game-changer - I actually respected it 5 out of 7 nights. Monday's W25 session was tough but I pushed through at about 88% intensity. Wednesday's W21 felt smoother, hit around 90% intensity. Friday I did W25 again and felt strong despite a slightly shorter sleep Thursday night - maintained 87% intensity. Saturday's W21 was excellent, 93% intensity, and I felt the recomp progress really showing in the mirror.

The post-workout Greek yogurt with berries experiment worked beautifully - I fell asleep faster on workout nights and felt more recovered. My sleep averaged 7.1 hours this week, up from 6.8 last week, which made a noticeable difference in my energy and workout performance. Weeknight sleep improved to 6.5-6.9 hours range, and I got solid 7.8-8.0 hours on weekend nights.

Nutrition was on point: averaged 2,105 kcal/day (99.7% of target) and protein hit 133g/day (100.8% of target). Budget stayed at 49.5 SAR/day, comfortably within my 50 SAR limit. Had a family gathering on Sunday with some extra calories (+240 kcal), but I adjusted Monday's portions slightly to balance it out.

Physically, I'm seeing continued progress - my jeans are looser around the waist, and my shoulders and arms look more defined. A gym regular asked if I'd been training longer, which was a nice validation. No injuries, minimal soreness beyond normal DOMS. The recovery-first mindset is really paying off.

One challenge: Tuesday evening I had a work deadline that pushed me to 10:15 PM, breaking my cutoff rule, which affected Wednesday morning energy slightly. But I adapted by doing a lighter warm-up on Wednesday and still completed the workout. Thursday I almost skipped due to fatigue but remembered my 75% adherence goal and pushed through with a modified intensity.

Next week's focus: maintain the 9:45 PM cutoff more strictly (maybe set a 9:30 PM warning alarm), continue the post-workout snack routine, and try to get 7+ hours of sleep at least 5 nights. I'm feeling strong and motivated as the recomp results become more visible!"
P14,2026-W07,20.2,24.3,59,2048,7,"Week 7 of 2026 was another strong week building on my momentum! I managed to complete all 4 planned workouts despite some scheduling challenges mid-week. My adherence remained high at around 75% overall when accounting for minor nutrition variations and one late work night that pushed my sleep down. The recomp progress is really showing now - I caught myself admiring my shoulder definition in the gym mirror during W25 on Friday, which felt amazing. My post-workout Greek yogurt routine is now automatic and I genuinely look forward to it. Energy levels stayed consistent throughout the week, and I'm sleeping well most nights.

Monday's W25 workout felt powerful - hit 90% adherence with great form on all compound movements. Wednesday's W21 session was solid at 88%, though I felt slightly fatigued from work stress. Friday's W25 was excellent at 91% - definitely my strongest session of the week. Saturday's W21 wrapped things up nicely at 85%, though I was a bit tired from the week.

Nutrition-wise, I stayed very close to targets averaging 2,048 kcal/day (just 16 over target), with protein at 129g/day. I had one social dinner Thursday that pushed me about 180 kcal over, but I naturally ate lighter Friday morning which balanced things out. Budget stayed perfect at 49.8 SAR/day average. My meal prep game is strong now - Sunday prep took only 90 minutes.

Sleep averaged 7.0 hours this week, slightly down from last week's 7.1 due to one rough Tuesday night (work deadline had me up until midnight, only got 6.2 hours). But I honored my cutoff alarm 6/7 nights which I'm proud of. Weekend sleep was restorative at 7.9 and 8.1 hours.

Physically, I'm seeing continued recomp - clothes fitting better around the waist, and my gym buddy asked if I've been doing extra shoulder work. Weight stayed stable as expected for recomp. No injuries, no setbacks. Motivation remains sky-high. I feel like I've found my sustainable rhythm and I'm excited to keep this going!"
P14,2026-W08,19.9,24.6,59.3,2087,7.1,"Week 8 was a strong continuation of my recomp journey! I hit all 4 scheduled workouts (Mon W25, Wed W21, Fri W25, Sat W21) with good intensity - Monday and Friday felt particularly powerful, while Wednesday was a bit of a grind due to Tuesday's shorter sleep. My adherence to the nutrition plan was around 78% this week, which is solid given a couple of real-world challenges.

The highlights: I'm seeing continued shoulder and upper arm definition, and my gym partner commented that my back is looking more sculpted during our Saturday session. The post-workout Greek yogurt routine is now automatic - I actually crave it after training. I maintained my work cutoff discipline 6 out of 7 nights, which protected my sleep and recovery.

Challenges this week included a Wednesday team lunch where I went about 220 kcal over target (chose grilled chicken shawarma but underestimated the tahini and pita), and a Sunday evening family gathering where I had an extra serving of kabsa that pushed me over by about 180 kcal. I compensated Thursday with a lighter dinner and added a 25-minute walk. My budget stayed tight at 49.2 SAR/day average - I'm getting really efficient with bulk chicken breast, eggs, and seasonal vegetables.

Sleep averaged 7.1 hours, with one rough night Tuesday (6.3h due to a project deadline) but I recovered well with 8.0h on Sunday. Energy levels remained high throughout the week. No injuries or soreness beyond normal DOMS. My waist measurements continue trending down slightly, and I'm noticing my jeans fit better around the waist while my upper body feels fuller.

The scale moved up slightly (+0.3kg) but I'm confident this is muscle given the visual changes and strength progression. I increased my dumbbell press weight by 2kg this week and held it for all sets. Motivation remains very high - I'm genuinely enjoying this process and the sustainable pace feels right. Looking forward to Week 9!"
P14,2026-W09,19.5,24.8,59.2,2038,7,"Week 9 of 2026 complete! This was a solid week with strong adherence despite a few curveballs. Started Monday with W25 (upper body strength) - felt powerful on the dumbbell press, managed to hold the +2kg increase from last week for all working sets. Tuesday was rough sleep-wise (only 6.4h due to work deadline), which made the W21 HIIT session Wednesday morning feel harder than usual, but I pushed through at about 87% intensity. Had a team lunch Wednesday that added ~200 kcal over plan - falafel wrap situation - but I adjusted dinner portions and skipped my evening snack to compensate.

Thursday's second W25 session was excellent - back and shoulders felt strong, and my training partner commented again on visible definition in my upper back. That feedback is incredibly motivating! Friday W21 cardio was solid, hit 90% intensity. Nutrition adherence hovered around 76% this week - Saturday I had a small dessert at a family gathering (+150 kcal), but overall I'm happy with how I'm managing social situations without derailing progress.

Budget came in at 48.7 SAR/day - I found chicken thighs on sale and meal-prepped Sunday, which helped. The post-workout Greek yogurt routine is now automatic, and I genuinely look forward to it. Sleep averaged 7.0h (that Tuesday dip brought the average down, but I caught up with 7.9h on Saturday). Waist continues to trend down slightly - jeans fitting differently in the best way. Upper body feels fuller and tighter. No injuries, energy levels good, and I successfully held work boundaries 6/7 nights (Thursday I answered one late email, but kept it brief).

Recomp is clearly happening - scale barely moved but mirror and measurements tell a different story. Strength gains continuing steadily. Really pleased with consistency and how sustainable this feels."

The shakshuka breakfast was delicious and filling, though I skipped it twice when I was running late for work and just grabbed a protein bar instead. The mixed nuts snack was perfect for my afternoon energy dip. I really enjoyed the Chicken Jollof Rice - made a big batch on Sunday and it lasted me through the week. The grilled fish dinners were light and satisfying, though I substituted salmon one night because it was on sale. My gym sessions were solid - completed all 4 workouts as planned. The upper body days felt challenging but manageable, and I'm definitely feeling stronger on my push exercises. Leg days were intense with the advanced programming, but I love the burn! I did have one rest day where I was too tired and skipped the gym, so only hit 3 out of 4 planned sessions. Sleep was consistent around 7 hours most nights. I'm noticing my clothes fitting a bit better around my waist, and I feel like my shoulders and arms are looking more defined. Energy levels have been good throughout the week. The budget worked out fine - I spent around 340 SAR for the week, well within my 350 SAR limit. Looking forward to continuing this momentum!"

I stuck to it about 75% of the time, but had to add extra protein and carbs around my workouts to avoid feeling completely depleted. The ful medames breakfast was filling and delicious, and I appreciated the Middle Eastern flavors. However, by day 3 I was experiencing significant hunger and low energy, especially before gym sessions. I added a protein shake post-workout on training days and increased portions slightly at dinner. The advanced gym workouts were intense - upper body and legs sessions really pushed me, but I managed to complete them all 4 days as planned. Recovery was harder than usual due to the caloric deficit. Sleep remained around 7 hours most nights, though I felt more fatigued.

I really enjoyed the hummus snack - it kept me satisfied between meals. The gym workouts were challenging but manageable. The advanced upper body session left me quite sore for two days, and I had to reduce the weight slightly on some exercises. Legs day was tough but I pushed through most of it. I did miss one workout day due to a work commitment. My energy levels have been good, and I'm sleeping well. I can feel myself getting stronger, and my clothes fit slightly better. The 2150 calorie target felt appropriate - I wasn't overly hungry or stuffed. I'm looking forward to continuing this plan with maybe some meal prep on weekends to save time during the week."

Energy levels were solid most days, though I felt a bit sluggish mid-week. The 1800 calories felt restrictive at times, especially post-workout, but I could see some definition starting to come through. Sleep was consistent around 7 hours, which helped with recovery."
P15,2025-W47,28.2,36.3,95.8,2650,6.7,"Week 47 was a solid effort overall, though I definitely felt the challenge of maintaining consistency with my 65% adherence tendency. Started strong on Monday and Tuesday, hitting both the diet targets and workouts (W25 and W21). The ful medames breakfast continues to be a winner - keeps me satisfied through the morning and fits my budget perfectly at around 8-10 SAR.

Wednesday was rough. Had a project deadline that pushed me into late evening, so I completely missed the W25 workout. Ended up grabbing a shawarma wrap (about 15 SAR) for dinner instead of my planned meal, which pushed me over calories by about 400. Not ideal, but sometimes life happens.

Thursday I got back on track with the W21 workout, though I was still feeling a bit sluggish from the previous day. Friday's workout felt great - I'm definitely seeing strength improvements in my compound lifts. The jareesh is starting to get repetitive though, as I noted last week. I experimented with adding extra cumin and black pepper which helped, but I might need to rotate in some other whole grains.

Weekend was mixed. Saturday I stuck to the diet well but skipped the planned cardio - just didn't have the motivation after a busy week. Sunday I meal-prepped for the upcoming week which helped me feel more in control. Overall, I'd say I hit about 70% adherence on diet and 75% on workouts this week, slightly better than my baseline.

The scale is moving in the right direction, down about 0.6 kg, which feels sustainable. I'm noticing my clothes fitting a bit better around the waist. Energy levels are good when I get my 7 hours of sleep, but I had two nights where I only got 6 hours due to work stress. Need to protect that sleep time better.

Biggest win: Stayed within budget all week except Wednesday, averaging about 33 SAR per day. Biggest challenge: Still not drinking enough water - I'm probably only hitting 1.5-2 liters most days when I should be closer to 3."
P15,2025-W48,27.9,36.4,95.4,2720,6.5,"Week 48 simulation complete. Started at 95.8kg with decent motivation but some familiar challenges crept in. Monday and Thursday workouts (W25 - upper body focus) went really well - felt strong on bench press and rows, added 2.5kg to my working sets. Tuesday's W21 (lower body) was solid but hamstrings were tight. Skipped Friday's workout completely - work project deadline hit hard and I was mentally drained by 6pm. Just couldn't get myself to the gym.

Diet adherence was around 65-70% as expected. Jareesh for breakfast is getting repetitive even with extra spices - by Thursday I swapped it for scrambled eggs with whole wheat toast twice. Stayed within budget mostly, but grabbed a shawarma wrap on Wednesday evening (about 45 SAR for meal + drink, so 10 SAR over). The grilled chicken meals are reliable and I'm getting better at meal prep on Sundays. Snacking on dates and nuts helped with energy dips.

Sleep was rough - averaged about 6.5 hours. Tuesday night only got 5.5 hours due to work stress and racing thoughts. Thursday was similar at 6 hours. Weekend sleep was better at 7-7.5 hours which helped recovery. Water intake still my weak point - maybe hitting 2L on good days, closer to 1.5L on busy days. Need to keep a bottle at my desk.

Body feels slightly leaner around the waist, belt is a tiny bit looser. Energy levels moderate - the sleep deficit definitely impacts afternoon performance. Some muscle soreness after the W25 sessions which is good. No injuries or issues. Weight trend seems stable with maybe slight downward movement but hard to tell with daily fluctuations."
P15,2025-W49,27.4,36.5,94.7,2695,6.5,"Week 49 was a mixed bag - I managed to stick to the plan better than last week, but still faced some challenges. The diet felt more manageable this time, maybe because I mentally prepared myself for the jareesh repetition. I did have one slip on Thursday when I grabbed a quick shawarma after a particularly brutal day at work, but otherwise kept things on track. Workouts were solid - completed 3 out of 4 sessions, which matches my usual pattern. My energy levels were decent despite the suboptimal sleep, though I really felt it by Friday. The 6.5 hours average is still not enough, and I know it's holding me back. Tuesday and Wednesday nights were rough with work stress keeping me up until past midnight.

On the positive side, I'm definitely seeing progress. My clothes fit better around the waist, and I added 2.5kg to my bench press and rows this week. The compound lifts are feeling stronger, which is encouraging. I'm also getting better at meal prep - made a big batch of jareesh on Sunday that lasted through Wednesday, which saved time and kept me honest with the diet.

Water intake remains a struggle - I'm averaging maybe 1.8L daily when I should be hitting 3L+. I keep forgetting my water bottle at home or in the car. Need to set phone reminders or something. The hamstring tightness from last week is mostly gone after focusing on stretching post-workout.

Friday's missed workout stung a bit. I got home at 8pm completely drained and just couldn't muster the energy. Chose sleep over the gym, which was probably the right call given how exhausted I was. Saturday's workout made up for it though - felt strong and focused.

Budget-wise, I stayed mostly on target except for that Thursday shawarma (43 SAR day). The rest of the days ranged from 33-37 SAR, which is within my 35 SAR daily allowance when averaged out. Buying in bulk and cooking at home definitely helps.

Overall, I'd rate this week a 7/10. Not perfect, but consistent enough to see results. The scale is moving in the right direction, and I can feel the difference in my body composition. Just need to work on that sleep and water intake."
P15,2025-W50,27,36.6,94.1,2780,6.5,"Week 50 was a solid effort with realistic challenges. Started strong Monday-Wednesday with good adherence to the meal plan and completed both scheduled workouts (W25 Monday, W21 Wednesday). The 2890 kcal target felt appropriate for my energy levels, though I had to adjust portion sizes slightly on Tuesday due to work meetings cutting into meal prep time.

Thursday brought the expected deviation - grabbed a shawarma combo after a long client presentation (480 kcal over target, 48 SAR spent). Honestly don't regret it as the mental break was needed. Friday's workout (W25) was completed but felt sluggish due to only 6 hours sleep Thursday night. The bench press progression stalled at last week's weight rather than adding the planned 2.5kg.

Weekend was mixed: Saturday's W21 workout was skipped entirely - combination of family obligations and genuine fatigue. Made up for it with a long walk (8,000 steps) and stuck to the meal plan. Sunday I did an abbreviated version of W21, about 60% completion, focusing on the compound lifts and skipping accessories.

Sleep remained problematic - averaged 6.5 hours with Tuesday being particularly rough (5.5 hours due to project deadline). Water intake improved to about 2L daily after setting phone reminders. The jareesh bulk prep strategy continued to save time and money, keeping most days within the 35 SAR budget.

Physically, I'm noticing slightly better definition in my shoulders and the belt feels looser by one notch. Energy levels are decent when sleep cooperates. The 65% adherence propensity feels accurate - I'm consistent enough to see progress but not obsessive about perfection. Work stress remains the biggest barrier, especially impacting Friday/Saturday recovery."
P15,2025-W51,26.7,36.7,93.7,2980,6.3,"Week 51 was a grind. Started strong Monday and Tuesday with solid adherence to both diet and workouts, hitting my W25 and W21 sessions with good energy despite the shorter sleep. Wednesday I felt the fatigue catching up—only managed 6 hours sleep and my workout intensity dropped to about 75%. The jareesh meal prep continues to be a lifesaver for staying on budget and hitting protein targets.

Thursday was rough. Work stress peaked and I ended up grabbing a shawarma wrap after a late meeting—probably added 400 extra calories. Sleep that night was terrible, maybe 5.5 hours. Friday's W25 workout suffered because of it; I completed about 80% but had to drop weight on my bench press sets. Still seeing that plateau there, which is frustrating.

Weekend was mixed. Saturday I skipped the planned W21 workout entirely due to a family gathering that ran long. Ate reasonably well at the event but definitely went over on portions—估 estimate maybe 200 kcal surplus. Sunday I rallied and did about 65% of the W21 workout, focusing on the compound movements and cutting the accessories short. Energy just wasn't there.

Positive notes: Water intake stayed consistent around 2L daily. My belt is definitely looser—I'm confidently on the next notch now. Shoulders and upper back are showing more definition when I check in the mirror. The scale moved down slightly which is encouraging. Rows are still progressing nicely, added another 2.5kg this week. Squat felt strong on Monday.

Barriers this week: Sleep averaged 6.3 hours, worse than my usual 6.5. Work deadline Tuesday bled into Wednesday stress. Saturday family event was unavoidable. General fatigue hit hard Thursday-Sunday. Budget was mostly good except Thursday's shawarma splurge at 45 SAR for the day.

Overall adherence: Diet maybe 66%, workouts about 65%. Not my best week but I kept showing up and that counts for something. Need to prioritize sleep better this coming week."
P15,2025-W52,26.5,36.8,93.3,2798,6.33,"Week 52 was a grind, honestly. Started strong Monday and Tuesday despite the work deadline pressure, but by Wednesday I was already feeling the sleep debt catching up. Thursday was brutal - only got about 5.5 hours of sleep and skipped the workout entirely. Grabbed shawarma for lunch because I needed something quick and comforting, which put me over budget and calories. Friday I dragged myself through about 80% of the W25 workout but my bench press is still stuck at the same weight - frustrating.

Saturday's family gathering was unavoidable, and I knew going in I'd be eating over target. Tried to make reasonable choices but still ended up around 2900 kcal for the day. Skipped the workout because of the event timing. Sunday I managed to push through about 65% of W21 despite being tired, but my form on squats wasn't great.

The positives: my jareesh meal prep from last week carried into Monday-Wednesday which kept me on track and under budget those days. Water intake stayed consistent around 2L daily. My rows are still progressing nicely - added another 2.5kg this week. The belt notch is definitely holding at the looser position, and I'm seeing more definition in my shoulders and upper back when I check in the mirror.

Overall adherence was right in my typical range - hit about 2 full workouts and 2 partial ones out of 4 planned. Diet was solid first half of the week, then the usual Thursday-Saturday slip pattern. Sleep averaged around 6.3 hours again, with that terrible Thursday night dragging things down. I'm noticing the cumulative fatigue is real - by Friday I'm just running on fumes.

Weight-wise, I'm down slightly from last week despite the weekend overage, which tells me the weekday discipline is paying off. Not dramatic changes, but steady progress. The bench plateau is getting in my head though - I need to maybe deload next week or switch up the rep scheme."
P15,2026-W01,26.3,36.7,92.9,2723,6.4,"Week 1 of 2026 was a mixed bag. Coming off the previous week with cumulative fatigue and sleep debt, I knew I needed to dial things in better. The diet target seemed really low at first glance (697 kcal total?) - I'm assuming this is meant to be a daily deficit or something got miscalculated, so I continued my usual 2700 kcal target for maintenance with slight deficit.

Monday started strong - hit W25 workout at 95% completion, good energy despite only 6.5 hours sleep. Kept diet tight at 2680 kcal, stayed within my 35 SAR budget. Tuesday was similar, W21 workout felt solid, managed full completion. Sleep improved slightly to 6.8 hours.

Wednesday is where things started sliding. Work stress ramped up again, only got 6 hours sleep, and the W25 workout suffered - completed maybe 70% before my lower back started complaining during squats. Didn't want to risk injury so I called it. Diet was okay, around 2720 kcal, but I was craving more carbs by evening.

Thursday was the planned W21 workout but I made a judgment call to skip it. Sleep was terrible (5.8 hours), felt run down, and honestly my body was telling me it needed rest more than another training session. Tried to keep diet reasonable but ended up at a work lunch where I had kabsa with colleagues - hit about 2890 kcal for the day and spent 42 SAR. Not terrible but over budget.

Friday I forced myself back to W25 despite low motivation. Got through about 85% - bench press still stuck at the same weight, frustrating. Sleep was 6.2 hours. Diet back on track at 2710 kcal, 36 SAR spent.

Weekend was better for recovery. Saturday skipped the W21 workout intentionally to let my body recover - this is becoming a pattern and I need to figure out if 4 days/week is too much with my current sleep and stress levels. Spent time with family, diet was controlled at 2650 kcal, 34 SAR. Got 7.1 hours sleep which felt amazing.

Sunday did the makeup W21 workout at about 75% intensity - more of a active recovery session. Rows felt good, added 2.5kg which was encouraging. Sleep was 6.4 hours. Diet 2700 kcal, 35 SAR.

Overall: 5 out of 7 workouts attempted, 4 completed at varying intensities. Average daily intake around 2735 kcal. Budget averaged 36.6 SAR/day (slightly over). Sleep averaged 6.4 hours (still not enough). Weight is down slightly, maybe 0.4-0.5 kg, but I think some of that is water and glycogen. Belt feels about the same. The bench plateau is really getting to me mentally. Upper back and shoulders continue to look better though.

The main issue is clear: sleep. Everything else suffers when I'm running on 6 hours or less. I need to prioritize getting to bed earlier, even if it means less evening screen time. The 4-day split might need to become a flexible 3-4 day depending on recovery. Diet adherence is actually pretty good when I plan ahead and cook at home."
P15,2026-W02,26.2,36.6,92.6,2763,6.3,"Week 2 of 2026 was a mixed bag - started strong but mid-week fatigue hit harder than expected. Monday and Tuesday felt productive with solid workouts and controlled eating. Wednesday's W25 session was rough; my lower back was still sensitive from last week, so I dialed back the squats and focused on form over weight. Thursday I completely skipped W21 - just couldn't muster the energy after only 5.5 hours of sleep and back-to-back stressful meetings at work. 

Friday I forced myself back to the gym for W25 and managed about 80% effort, which felt like a win given my state. The weekend was better - got proper rest Saturday (7.2 hours!) and did a lighter W21 session Sunday focusing on technique and mobility. 

Diet-wise, I stayed pretty close to target most days. Tuesday I had a work lunch that pushed me to 2890 kcal and 43 SAR - the grilled chicken platter with extra rice did me in. Friday I also went slightly over budget trying to meal prep for the weekend. The rest of the days I kept things tight with my usual rotation: eggs and labneh for breakfast, chicken shawarma bowls for lunch, and grilled meat with vegetables for dinner.

Sleep remained my biggest enemy - averaged 6.3 hours which is barely sustainable. Work stress didn't let up until Friday afternoon. I'm noticing the cumulative fatigue is affecting my recovery and strength progression. Bench press is still stuck at the same weight, though I did manage to add 2.5kg to my rows on Sunday which felt good.

Water intake was consistent at 2.1-2.4L daily. My belt is still on the same notch, which is frustrating, but I can see some definition in my shoulders and upper back when the lighting is right. Weight on the scale dropped slightly by mid-week but bounced back after the weekend - probably water retention from higher carbs Saturday.

Overall adherence was about what I'd expect from myself - 65% sounds right. I completed 3 out of 4 planned workouts with varying intensity, stayed mostly within budget except two days, and kept protein intake high. The back discomfort is concerning and I need to be more careful with form on heavy compound movements."
P15,2026-W03,26.1,36.5,92.4,2750,6.47,"Week 3 felt like a grind, honestly. Started Monday with decent energy after the weekend rest, hit W25 at about 85% - back felt okay but I'm still being cautious with the squats. Tuesday's W21 session was solid, maybe my best of the week at 95% completion. Energy was there and I pushed the accessory work harder than usual.

Wednesday is where things started sliding. W25 again but only managed about 70% - the back tightness crept back during warm-ups and I just couldn't trust myself under heavier squat loads. Cut the volume and called it. Thursday was supposed to be W21 but I completely skipped it. Work was brutal, only got 5.8 hours of sleep the night before, and I just had nothing in the tank. Felt guilty about it but also knew forcing it would've been counterproductive.

Friday I dragged myself in for W25 and got through maybe 75% of it. Form was okay but the weights felt heavier than they should. Weekend was better - got proper sleep Saturday night (7.5 hours, finally!) and Sunday's W21 session hit about 90%. Managed to add 2.5kg to my barbell rows which felt like a small win after the week's struggles.

Diet-wise, I tried to stay closer to budget this week after last week's overage. Monday through Wednesday were pretty tight - 35, 34, 36 SAR respectively. Thursday I stress-ate a bit and went to 41 SAR with some extra snacks. Friday's meal prep came in at 38 SAR, still over but not terrible. Weekend was disciplined: 33 SAR Saturday, 35 SAR Sunday. Calories averaged around 2750 daily, so just slightly above target but way more consistent than previous weeks.

Sleep remains my Achilles heel. Averaged 6.4 hours, which is barely better than my baseline 6.3. The Thursday crash at 5.8 hours really hurt, and even though Saturday's 7.5 hours felt amazing, it wasn't enough to fully recover the deficit. I'm waking up tired most mornings and needing coffee to function.

Physically, I don't see much change in the mirror. Weight seems stable around 92.3-92.5kg range. Belt is still on the same notch. The back issue is frustrating - it's not acute pain, just this persistent awareness that makes me second-guess heavy squats. Bench press is still stuck; didn't attempt any progression this week. The row progression on Sunday was encouraging though.

Mood-wise, I'm feeling a bit discouraged. Missing Thursday's workout bothered me more than it probably should have. The sleep debt is affecting my mental state - I'm more irritable at work and less motivated in general. I know I need to prioritize sleep but work deadlines keep pushing it down the priority list.

Water intake was consistent at 2.2-2.5L daily. At least that's one thing I'm nailing. Overall adherence I'd calculate at about 68% - completed 3.5 out of 4 workouts (counting reduced intensity days), stayed closer to budget, but still struggling with the fundamentals like sleep and progressive overload."
P15,2026-W04,26,36.5,92.3,2760,6.4,"Week 4 was a mixed bag that felt like one step forward, half a step back. Monday started strong with W25 - I hit 80% completion, managing squats more carefully and keeping back awareness high throughout. Energy was decent despite only 6.3 hours sleep. Tuesday's W21 session was excellent at 90% - felt powerful on bench and rows, though still no weight progression on bench. The 6.9 hours of sleep really helped.

Wednesday is where things started sliding. Back tightness crept in during W25, forcing me to drop squat volume again - only managed 65% completion. Combined with 6.0 hours sleep, I could feel the fatigue accumulating. Thursday was supposed to be W21 but after 5.9 hours sleep and lingering back discomfort, I made the call to skip it entirely (0%). Better to rest than risk injury, but it stung mentally.

Friday's W25 session was a grind at 70% - everything felt heavy, form was sloppy on later sets, and I cut it short. The 6.2 hours sleep wasn't helping. Saturday's rest day with 7.3 hours sleep was desperately needed and I woke up feeling human again. Sunday's W21 bounced back to 85% - added 2.5kg to rows again (small win!), focused hard on form, and felt the benefits of proper rest.

Diet-wise, I stayed more disciplined this week. Monday through Wednesday averaged 2740 kcal and kept within budget at 34-36 SAR daily. Thursday was the danger zone - stress from skipping the workout led to comfort eating, hitting 2870 kcal and 42 SAR (snack binge on nuts and dates). Friday and Saturday I reined it in to 2780 and 2690 kcal respectively, with Sunday at 2750 kcal. Weekly average came to 2760 kcal/day and 36.7 SAR/day - exceeded budget by 1.7 SAR/day but better than some previous weeks.

Sleep averaged 6.4 hours, virtually identical to last week despite my best efforts. The Saturday recovery sleep helped prevent complete burnout. Water intake stayed consistent at 2.3-2.6L daily. Weight fluctuated between 92.2-92.6kg throughout the week, ending at 92.3kg - essentially maintenance.

The persistent back issue is becoming my primary barrier. It's not acute pain, just chronic tightness that kills my squat confidence and prevents progressive overload. I'm compensating well on upper body (rows progressing nicely), but lower body work remains compromised. The Thursday skip was necessary but hurt my adherence - calculated at 64% for the week (2.6/4 workouts with intensity reductions factored).

Body composition feels static. Mirror shows no visible changes, belt notch unchanged, minimal shoulder definition persists. At this calorie level with inconsistent training intensity, I'm essentially spinning wheels. The sleep deficit continues to undermine recovery and fat loss efforts.

Positives: Row progression continues, made smarter decision to skip Thursday rather than push through, diet control improved except Thursday's stress response, Saturday rest was effective. Negatives: back issue unresolved and limiting progress, sleep remains inadequate, mid-week energy crashes persist, no measurable body composition changes, motivational dips after missed sessions.

Moving forward, I need to address the back issue properly - maybe see a physio or deload squats for two weeks. Sleep needs systemic change, not just weekend catch-up. Budget adherence was closer but Thursday showed I still stress-eat when things go sideways. The 2760 kcal average is slightly below target, which should create a small deficit, but without consistent training intensity and adequate recovery, fat loss remains elusive."
P15,2026-W05,25.9,36.5,92,2781,6.3,"Week 5 was a grinding test of willpower against mounting fatigue and that persistent back demon. Started Monday optimistic after Sunday's strong session, but reality hit hard by mid-week. Completed 3 out of 4 scheduled workouts (75% adherence), which feels like a win given circumstances but falls short of my usual standard. The back tightness became the week's defining character - it dictated exercise selection, killed my squat confidence, and forced constant mental recalculation during sessions.

Monday's W25 went surprisingly well at 85% intensity. I modified squats to goblet squats with lighter weight, focusing on form and keeping tension out of my lower back. It worked - no flare-ups. Tuesday's W21 was solid at 90%, pushed through despite only 6.1 hours sleep. Felt the cumulative fatigue but the workout structure kept me engaged. Wednesday I hit the wall - only managed 60% of W25, cut volume significantly. My back was barking, sleep debt was real (5.8 hours), and work stress was climbing. Made the call to preserve what I could rather than push into injury territory.

Thursday was the breaking point. Skipped W21 entirely - second week in a row missing Thursday. The pattern is undeniable: by day four, my body and mind are depleted. Slept only 5.7 hours Wednesday night, woke up with back stiffness, and decided rest was non-negotiable. Felt guilty but also relieved. The comfort eating returned - hit 2890 kcal and blew 43.5 SAR on takeout shawarma and kunafa. The emotional eating is becoming a Thursday ritual I need to break.

Friday through Sunday I regrouped. Didn't train Friday (not scheduled), focused on sleep recovery, meal prep, and gentle stretching. Saturday's 7.1 hours of sleep was a lifeline. Sunday I came back strong with W21 at 88% - modified deadlifts to Romanian deadlifts with perfect form, felt my hamstrings working without back compensation. Small victory but meaningful.

Diet averaged 2781 kcal daily - only 19 kcal over target, which is excellent control except for Thursday's blowout. Stayed at 36.9 SAR/day average (1.9 over budget, 5.4% overage). The Thursday spike accounts for most of that. Protein stayed high at 205g average, which protected muscle during the stress. Hydration consistent at 2.4-2.7L daily.

Sleep remains the weak link: 6.3 hour average with only Saturday breaking 7 hours. The sleep debt is cumulative and clearly impacting recovery, mood, and decision-making. I can feel it in my joints, my patience, and my workout intensity. Thursday's crash is directly linked to inadequate sleep Tuesday-Wednesday.

Weight dropped slightly to 92.0kg by week's end (down 0.3kg), which is encouraging but modest. No visible body composition changes - still wearing the same belt notch, shirts fit the same. The scale movement might be water fluctuation or slight fat loss, hard to tell. Muscle mass holding steady around 36.5kg, which given the reduced training volume and stress levels, is acceptable.

The back issue is now officially a chronic problem requiring intervention. I can't keep modifying workouts indefinitely. Need to either see a physiotherapist or commit to a dedicated mobility/rehab protocol. It's limiting squat progression, creating anxiety before leg days, and forcing suboptimal exercise substitutions. This is costing me gains and confidence.

Positives: maintained protein intake under stress, made smart decisions to avoid injury, showed resilience bouncing back Sunday, kept diet mostly on track. Negatives: missed another Thursday workout, sleep debt accumulating, back issue unresolved, emotional eating pattern emerging, training intensity compromised.

Looking ahead: Week 6 needs a strategic shift. Can't keep grinding through barriers expecting different results. Priorities: (1) Address back issue - book assessment or start daily mobility routine, (2) Protect Thursday - either move rest day or implement pre-emptive stress management, (3) Sleep intervention - aim for 7+ hours at least 4 nights, (4) Meal prep Sunday to prevent Thursday takeout temptation. The 65% adherence propensity is proving accurate - I'm hovering right at that threshold. To break through, I need to remove barriers, not just push harder. The intermediate fitness level means I have capacity, but the lifestyle factors are the real limiters now."
P15,2026-W06,25.8,36.4,91.8,2798,6.3,"Week 6 was a mixed bag - started strong but hit the same Thursday wall again. The back issue is improving with the exercise modifications, which is a relief. I managed to complete 3 out of 4 planned workouts (75% adherence, right at my propensity level), but the pattern is getting predictable: Monday and Tuesday I'm motivated and energized, Wednesday I start feeling the fatigue creep in, Thursday I crash, then I slowly recover through the weekend.

Monday's W25 session felt solid at 80% intensity - the goblet squats are definitely easier on my lower back than traditional back squats. Tuesday's W21 workout was probably my best of the week at 88% intensity. I felt strong and the movements were clean. Wednesday's W25 was rough - only managed about 55% intensity. My back was tight, sleep debt was catching up (only 5.9 hours that night), and I could feel myself dragging through the sets.

Thursday... skipped again. Same pattern as last week. Woke up exhausted after 5.6 hours of sleep, back was stiff, and I just couldn't muster the energy. Made poor food choices that evening - ordered takeout shawarma and ate way over budget at 2,950 kcal and 44 SAR. I know this is becoming a pattern and I need to address it proactively rather than just hoping next Thursday will be different.

Took Friday as a rest day (wasn't scheduled anyway), got better sleep Saturday night (7.2 hours - finally!), and came back Sunday with a decent W21 session at 82% intensity. The Romanian deadlifts are working well as a back-friendly alternative.

Diet-wise, I averaged 2,798 kcal/day - about 75 kcal over my 2,723 target. That's roughly 2.8% over, which isn't terrible but it's not creating the deficit I need for fat loss either. Budget was 37.2 SAR/day, which is 2.2 SAR over my 35 SAR limit (6.3% overage). The Thursday blowout really skewed both numbers.

Sleep averaged 6.3 hours again - exactly the same as last week. Only Saturday gave me adequate rest. I'm starting to realize this chronic sleep debt is probably my biggest barrier. When I'm tired, everything else falls apart: workout intensity drops, food discipline weakens, recovery suffers, and my back gets tighter.

Weight dropped slightly from 92.0 to 91.8 kg (-0.2 kg), but honestly, that could just be water weight fluctuation. I don't see any visible changes in the mirror. Muscle mass seems stable around 36.4-36.5 kg, and body fat is hovering at 25.8-25.9%. My belt is still on the same notch.

Positives: I'm being smart about the back issue and not pushing through pain. The exercise modifications are working. I'm maintaining muscle mass despite the modest deficit. Water intake has been consistent at 2.5-2.8L daily. Protein averaged 203g, which is good for muscle preservation.

The reality check: I'm stuck in a maintenance pattern rather than making real fat loss progress. The weekly calorie average is too close to maintenance, especially when factoring in the Thursday spikes. My 65% adherence propensity is proving accurate - I'm consistently hitting 75% of workouts, which is close to that threshold. 

What needs to change: I need a proactive Thursday strategy. Maybe meal prep Wednesday night so healthy food is ready Thursday. Or schedule Thursday as an active rest day with just a walk instead of a full workout, removing the pressure. The sleep issue needs addressing too - maybe earlier bedtime on weeknights, even if it means less evening screen time. The back tightness requires dedicated mobility work, not just exercise swaps.

I'm not discouraged, but I'm also not making the progress I want. This feels like I'm treading water rather than swimming toward the shore. The good news is the patterns are clear now, which means I can actually do something about them."
P15,2026-W07,25.5,36.5,91.3,2741,7.1,"Week 7 complete. This week felt like a turning point - I actually implemented some of the strategic changes I've been avoiding. Sleep protocol started Monday with a strict 10:30pm phone-away rule, and I hit 7+ hours four nights this week (huge improvement from last week's single night). The Thursday curse finally broke - I meal prepped Sunday specifically for Thursday's danger zone, and scheduled my workout for 6am instead of evening. It worked: completed all 4 planned workouts for the first time in weeks.

Workouts felt noticeably stronger with better sleep. Monday's W25 at 85% felt controlled, back stayed quiet during goblet squats (up to 28kg now). Tuesday W21 cardio intervals at 90% - actually enjoyed it with more energy. Wednesday's W25 at 78% was harder (sleep dipped to 6.1hr), but I pushed through. Thursday morning workout at 82% was the game-changer - doing it before work eliminated the evening fatigue excuse, and having pre-portioned meals prevented the usual 3000-calorie blowout. I only hit 2680 kcal that day with 33 SAR spent.

Diet averaged 2741 kcal/day (38 kcal under target!), first week under target in a while. Budget was 36.1 SAR/day - still 1.1 over, but trending right. The Sunday meal prep (2.5 hours, 85 SAR for the week's proteins and vegetables) front-loaded costs but saved daily decisions. Protein averaged 206g, fiber 35g, water 2.7-3.1L daily.

Back feels significantly better - the consistent mobility work (10min daily) plus proper sleep is paying off. I can feel my core engaging better during lifts. Belt notch feels slightly looser but I'm not moving it yet - being conservative.

Weight dropped from 91.8 to 91.3kg (-0.5kg). I know some is water, but this feels more substantial than previous weeks. Body composition scanner showed muscle at 36.5kg (stable, maybe +0.1kg) and fat percentage at 25.5% (down from 25.8%). That's approximately 0.3kg fat loss if accurate - modest but in the right direction finally.

The mental shift is the biggest win. Proving I can complete 4/4 workouts and stay under calorie target simultaneously breaks the 'maintenance trap' I was in. Thursday morning workouts are non-negotiable going forward. Sleep average of 7.1 hours (Mon 7.3, Tue 7.5, Wed 6.1, Thu 6.8, Fri 7.2, Sat 8.0, Sun 6.9) is transformative compared to the chronic 6.3hr debt.

Barriers addressed: Thursday protocol successful (morning workout + meal prep), sleep intervention working (4/7 days >7hr vs 1/7 last week), back mobility routine established. Remaining challenges: Wednesday sleep still problematic (work stress), budget discipline needs another 1-2 SAR/day reduction, need to maintain this 4/4 workout consistency.

Next week goals: repeat 4/4 workouts, keep morning Thursday slot, get 5/7 nights >7hr sleep, hit 35 SAR/day average, add 5min evening mobility routine on non-workout days. Feels sustainable and I'm finally seeing the trajectory shift from maintenance to actual progress."
P15,2026-W08,25.2,36.5,90.9,2748,6.8,"Week 8 complete - what a contrast to last week's breakthrough. Reality check hit hard: managed 3/4 workouts (75% adherence, still above my 65% baseline but felt the drop from last week's perfect 4/4). The Thursday curse tried to return with a vengeance - work crisis had me in meetings until 7pm, missed the morning workout window completely. Salvaged Friday instead with an early session, but the momentum break was noticeable.

Sleep was the real struggle this week: averaged 6.8 hours (down from 7.1hr last week). The 10:30pm phone-away protocol worked Monday-Wednesday, but Thursday's work stress had me doom-scrolling until midnight (4.9 hours sleep - brutal). Weekend tried to compensate with 7.8hr Saturday and 7.5hr Sunday, but the damage was done. My body felt it - recovery was slower, workouts felt heavier than they should.

Diet held surprisingly steady despite the chaos: 2,748 kcal/day average (17 kcal under target), 35.8 SAR/day (just 0.8 over budget - my best budget week yet!). The Sunday meal prep from last week saved me - having prepped proteins and roasted vegetables meant I didn't spiral into expensive takeout when Thursday imploded. Thursday itself was 2,820 kcal/37 SAR (not perfect but way better than the old 2,950+/44+ pattern). Protein averaged 204g, fiber 33g, water 2.5-3.0L daily.

Weight: 91.3→90.9kg (-0.4kg). Composition scan shows this is approximately 0.2kg fat loss + 0.2kg water/glycogen fluctuation. Muscle mass held at 36.5kg (stable, which I'll take given the sleep deficit). Fat percentage: 25.5%→25.2% (-0.3%, continuing the downward trend from last week). Two consecutive weeks of fat loss - this is actually happening.

Workouts: Mon W25 at 82% intensity (felt strong, good start), Tue W21 at 88% (pushed hard), Wed W25 at 76% (fatigue showing from poor Thursday sleep-in-advance), skipped Thu W21 (work crisis), recovered Fri W21 at 79% (grateful I could salvage this). Goblet squats holding at 28kg, focusing on form over progression this week. Back mobility routine only happened 4/7 days - noticed stiffness returning by Friday.

The wins: Budget discipline paying off (35.8 SAR is closest I've been to target), meal prep strategy proving its worth, still maintaining >65% workout adherence despite major Thursday disruption, fat loss continuing for second week. The reality checks: Sleep regression is concerning (6.8hr isn't sustainable), missed mobility routine days correlate with back tightness, one work crisis nearly derailed everything, mental fatigue from poor sleep affected workout quality.

Psychological state: More grounded than last week's high. Last week felt like ""I've figured it out!"" - this week reminded me this is a process with ups and downs. But here's the thing: even my ""down"" week was still a win by old standards. 3/4 workouts, budget nearly hit, continuing fat loss, no complete derailments. The systems I've built (meal prep, morning workout slots, phone-away protocol) caught me when I stumbled.

The Thursday pattern is real though - two weeks of data confirms it's my vulnerability point. Need to build even more redundancy around it. Maybe Wednesday night meal prep specifically for Thursday? Or blocking Thursday mornings as non-negotiable in my calendar?

Looking at the two-week trend: 91.8→91.3→90.9kg (-0.9kg total), fat 25.8%→25.5%→25.2% (-0.6% total), muscle stable at 36.5kg. This is sustainable fat loss territory (0.45kg/week average). Not dramatic, but real and maintainable.

Next week focus: Get sleep back to 7+ hours (5/7 nights minimum), complete 4/4 workouts again (prove last week wasn't a fluke), maintain budget discipline (35.8 was so close to 35!), hit mobility routine 6/7 days (back health is non-negotiable), implement Thursday-specific protection strategy. The foundation is solid - now I need to stabilize it."
P15,2026-W09,24.9,36.5,90.5,2791,6.6,"Week 9 complete. This was a reality check week - hit the adherence ceiling hard. Started strong with 3 workouts in first 4 days, but Friday's work crisis cascaded into weekend disruption. Sleep averaged 6.6hr (down from 6.8hr last week), with two brutal nights under 6hr that tanked recovery. Only completed 3/4 workouts (75% adherence again, matching propensity), missing Saturday's W25 after Friday's 5.1hr sleep disaster. Diet held surprisingly well at 2,791 kcal/day (+6 over target) and 35.2 SAR/day (+0.2 over budget) - meal prep systems continue proving their worth even when life gets chaotic.

Weight: 90.9→90.5kg (-0.4kg, third consecutive week of losses). Body comp shows the grind paying off: muscle maintained at 36.5kg (protein averaging 207g kept this stable), fat 25.2%→24.9% (-0.3%, now -0.9% over three weeks). This is real fat loss, not water fluctuation. The math is working even when execution isn't perfect.

Workout quality was bipolar. Monday's W25 at 86% felt great (7.3hr sleep helped), Tuesday's W21 hit 91% intensity (best in weeks), Wednesday's W25 dropped to 73% as cumulative fatigue hit. Friday's crisis meant 11hr workday plus only 5.1hr sleep, so Saturday's workout was a non-starter - chose recovery over forcing it. Back stiffness returned with vengeance by Thursday, only did mobility 3/7 days.

The concerning pattern: I'm maintaining 75% workout adherence but can't break through to 100% (4/4). Two weeks now of 3/4 completions. Sleep is the obvious culprit - only 2/7 nights over 7hr this week (Mon 7.3hr, Sun 7.6hr). The Thursday-Friday crisis pattern is becoming predictable: work stress → late night → poor sleep → missed workout. Need better crisis protocols.

Bright spots: Didn't stress-eat during Friday's chaos (stayed at 2,805 kcal/36.1 SAR), goblet squats progressed to 30kg on Monday (finally!), water intake solid at 2.7L average. The systems (meal prep, morning workout slots, budget tracking) are keeping the floor high even when the ceiling stays frustratingly out of reach.

Psychological state: frustrated but not defeated. Three weeks of consistent fat loss proves the process works. I'm not failing - I'm succeeding at 75% when my propensity is 65%. But I want that 100% week. The gap between what I'm doing (good) and what I know I'm capable of (great) is annoying. Sleep is clearly the bottleneck - everything else cascades from that.

Next week priorities: (1) 5/7 nights >7hr sleep (non-negotiable, will set hard 22:30 phone-down rule), (2) Friday crisis protocol (pre-log workout as 'optional recovery' to remove decision fatigue), (3) mobility routine 6/7 days (back is screaming for this), (4) attempt 4/4 workouts but with smarter recovery assessment. The three-week fat loss trend is gold - need to protect it while fixing the sleep foundation."

Energy levels were good during training. Sleep remained around my usual 6.5 hours due to work commitments. Noticed slight improvements in muscle definition, particularly in shoulders and arms. Weight dropped modestly which is encouraging. Need to be more consistent with the fish meal - only had it 4 times this week."

I managed to stick to the meal plan about 65% of the time - the Ful Medames breakfast was filling and easy to prepare, and I really enjoyed the Bukhari Rice with Chicken. The labneh snack was convenient for work days. I did struggle a bit with portion control on the stuffed peppers a couple of evenings, and had to eat out twice this week which threw off my macros. The workouts were challenging but good - the advanced upper body session really pushed me, though I had to skip one leg day due to a work commitment. My energy levels were decent despite the slight calorie deficit, though I noticed some afternoon fatigue on days when I didn't hit my protein target. Sleep remained around my usual 6.5 hours - tried to get more but work stress kept me up a couple nights. I can feel a slight difference in how my clothes fit, and the scale is moving in the right direction. Looking forward to being more consistent next week."

A couple of evenings I ended up eating out with colleagues and went over my calorie target by around 300-400 kcal those days. The shrimp and couscous dinner became my favorite meal. I hit all 4 gym sessions as planned - the advanced upper body and legs workouts were challenging but felt good. My muscles are definitely feeling it, especially after leg day. Energy levels were solid mid-week but I felt a bit tired towards the weekend, probably because my sleep didn't improve much. I'm averaging around 2600 kcal daily when I account for the days I went off-plan. Seeing some minor changes on the scale which is encouraging. Need to be more consistent with meal prep on weekends to avoid those restaurant meals."

The Mandi chicken dinner was great but I had to eat out twice this week for work events so couldn't follow the plan perfectly those days. Workouts went well - completed 3 out of 4 planned sessions. Had to skip one leg day due to a late work meeting. The upper body sessions felt solid, seeing good pump and strength is maintaining. Energy levels were good most days, though the 6.5 hours sleep is catching up with me by Friday. I'm feeling slightly leaner around the midsection and my pants fit a bit better. The calorie target felt appropriate - not too hungry but not overly full. Need to prep meals better on weekends to avoid those work dinner situations."

The shakshuka breakfast was great and filling, but by mid-morning I often needed more fuel. Workouts were intense; the advanced upper body and legs sessions really pushed me. Recovery took longer than expected with the calorie deficit. I noticed improved definition in my abs and shoulders by day 5-6. Energy dipped mid-week, likely due to the aggressive deficit combined with high training volume. Sleep remained around my usual 6.5 hours - tried to get more but work stress kept that consistent.

Managed to hit the gym 3 times this week instead of the planned 4 - missed one upper body session due to a work deadline. The advanced workouts were intense, especially the leg day. I felt strong during exercises but noticed some fatigue mid-week, probably due to my usual 6.5 hours of sleep. Energy levels were decent overall. I did have one cheat meal on Friday evening with friends. Noticed slightly better definition in my abs by the end of the week, and the scale showed a small drop.

The shakshouka for breakfast was actually really good and I managed to make it most mornings, though a couple times I just had the eggs scrambled because I was running late. The workouts were honestly too advanced for me - I'm marked as a beginner but these were labeled 'Advanced' and I really struggled. I could only complete about half the exercises properly and had to skip some entirely or use much lighter weights. My shoulders were so sore after the upper body days. I stuck to the meal plan about 4 days out of 7 - the other days I added a bit more food because 1400 calories left me really hungry, especially on workout days. The lentil jareesh was filling but took longer to cook than I thought. I'm still not sleeping great, averaging around 6-7 hours. I can feel some changes in my energy but the scale hasn't moved much.

P16,2025-W47,39.3,24.6,81.4,2680,6.6,"This week was challenging but I stuck with it better than I expected. The meal plan was a lot of food - 2534 calories felt like too much at first, but I was hungrier than usual with the workouts. I managed to follow the diet about 60% of the time, which is decent for me. The workouts were HARD - W25 and W21 are clearly designed for someone more advanced than me. I completed all 4 scheduled sessions but had to modify almost everything. For example, I couldn't do full push-ups so I did knee push-ups, and I had to take longer rest breaks. By Wednesday I was really sore and almost skipped the second workout, but I pushed through with lighter weights. The cooking was overwhelming at times since I'm a beginner in the kitchen - I ended up repeating simpler meals and eating out twice when I ran out of time. My budget of 30 SAR per day was tight, especially when I grabbed quick meals. Sleep stayed around my usual 6.5 hours - I tried to get more but work stress kept me up. I did notice my energy improved slightly by the end of the week, and my clothes feel just a tiny bit looser. The scale barely moved but I know it's early. I'm proud I showed up for all the workouts even though they were modified."
P16,2025-W48,39,24.7,80.9,2520,6.5,"Week 2 is complete and honestly, it was tougher than Week 1. I knew what was coming this time, which helped with prep but also made me a bit anxious about the workouts. Monday's W25 session left me sore again - those squats and lunges really get me. I'm still modifying heavily, using 3kg dumbbells instead of the recommended weights, but at least I'm showing up. Wednesday's W21 cardio intervals were brutal; I had to walk more than jog, maybe 60/40 split. My cooking is still pretty basic - lots of grilled chicken, rice, and steamed veggies on repeat. I did meal prep on Sunday which helped, but by Thursday I was so tired of the same flavors that I grabbed a chicken shawarma plate (tried to keep it reasonable, no extra sauces). Friday's workout was the hardest - I only slept 5.5 hours Thursday night because of work stress, and I almost skipped it entirely. Pushed through but cut it short by about 10 minutes. Saturday's W21 was better, felt a bit stronger. My budget is really tight though - spent about 215 SAR this week on groceries and those two times I ate out. The protein requirements are expensive! I'm eating more eggs and canned tuna to save money. Sleep is still my biggest issue - averaging around 6.5 hours when I know I need 8. I can feel it affecting my recovery and my hunger levels. I'm hungrier on workout days and added probably 200-300 extra calories on three days this week, mostly from nuts and an extra protein shake. The scale is moving a tiny bit, which is encouraging, but my clothes don't feel much different yet. My energy is slightly better than Week 1, maybe my body is adapting? DOMS wasn't as bad this week except after Monday. No injuries, just general fatigue. I'd say I stuck to the plan about 55-60% - did all 4 workouts but modified them significantly, hit my protein target maybe 5 out of 7 days, and stayed within 200 calories of my target most days. The weekends are hardest because my routine is different. Overall, I'm proud I didn't quit, but I'm not sure how sustainable this is long-term with my current budget and sleep situation."
P16,2025-W49,38.7,24.8,80.3,2680,6.5,"Week 2 (W49) was honestly a mixed bag. I started with good intentions after meal prepping Sunday, but by Wednesday I was already sick of eating the same chicken and rice. The workouts felt slightly easier than Week 1 - my body is adapting I think - but I'm still modifying almost everything. Did all 4 scheduled sessions (Mon/Wed/Fri/Sat) which I'm proud of, but Thursday's workout was particularly rough because I only slept 5 hours the night before. I almost skipped Friday's W25 session entirely.

The budget situation is getting stressful. I spent about 218 SAR this week, which is over my 210 limit. I tried buying more eggs and canned tuna to save money, but then caved and got shawarma on Thursday (85 SAR for the plate!) because I was exhausted and hungry. Saturday I grabbed a grilled chicken wrap too. Both times I tried to stay near my calorie goals but I know the sodium was way over.

Hunger has been intense on workout days. I added 200-300 extra calories on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday just to function. My energy is slightly better than Week 1, but I'm still dragging by afternoon. The 6.5 hours of sleep isn't cutting it - I know I need 7-8 but work and life keep getting in the way.

Positives: DOMS is definitely less severe. I'm not waddling around like Week 1. I can feel myself getting slightly stronger even with the modified weights. My clothes might be fitting a tiny bit better? Hard to tell. Scale shows a small drop which is encouraging.

Concerns: I don't know if I can sustain this financially. The protein requirements are expensive and I'm already cutting corners. The sleep deficit is catching up with me. I'm worried about burnout. Motivation is hovering around 6/10 - not terrible but not great either. The meal prep thing works for 3-4 days max before I want to throw the containers out the window.

Next week I need to find cheaper protein sources and maybe simpler meals. Also need to prioritize sleep somehow. But overall, I showed up and did the work, even if it wasn't perfect."
P16,2025-W50,38.5,24.6,79.8,2580,6.5,"Week 3 (W50) wrapped up and honestly, I'm feeling pretty drained. The 6.5 hours of sleep is really catching up with me - I can feel it in my workouts and my decision-making around food. Started the week motivated after seeing some progress last week, but by Wednesday I was already struggling with the same issues: energy crashes mid-afternoon, cravings for something more exciting than chicken and rice, and those damn modifications during workouts that make me feel like I'm not really progressing.

Monday's W25 workout was okay - still doing 40% weight reductions on the leg press and goblet squats, but I pushed through. Tuesday I meal prepped but was so tired I nearly ordered in. Wednesday's W21 upper body session was rough; my shoulders felt weak on the overhead press and I had to drop to 5kg dumbbells. By Thursday I was so sick of the bland food that I grabbed a chicken shawarma wrap after work (about 45 SAR with a drink). Friday's W25 felt better surprisingly - maybe the extra calories helped? But then Saturday I was exhausted from the week and skipped the planned W21 session entirely. Felt guilty but also just couldn't face it.

Sunday I did make up the workout but it was half-hearted. The DOMS isn't as bad as Week 1 anymore, which I guess is progress? But I'm also worried I'm not pushing hard enough. The budget situation is stressing me out - I went over again this week, probably around 225 SAR total. Had to grab a quick meal at a café on Saturday (protein bowl, 38 SAR) because I hadn't prepped enough and was starving. 

The scale is moving slowly in the right direction which keeps me going, but I'm really questioning if I can sustain this. The cooking is getting slightly easier - I can do the basic chicken and rice without thinking now - but the variety is killing me. I need to figure out how to make this more interesting without blowing the budget. Sleep is non-negotiable with my work schedule, so that's not changing. 

Positives: I'm showing up most days, the workouts are becoming familiar even if I'm modifying them, and I haven't injured myself. Negatives: energy is low, adherence to the meal plan is maybe 50% this week, budget overrun continues, and I skipped one workout. Motivation is hovering around 5/10. I need Week 4 to be better or I'm going to burn out."
P16,2025-W51,38.4,24.4,79.5,2685,6.3,"Week 51 (Dec 16-22) was honestly one of my toughest weeks yet. I started with good intentions but everything just felt harder than usual. My motivation was barely hanging on at around 4/10 most days, and the low energy from only getting 6.5 hours of sleep really caught up with me.

Workout-wise, I managed to complete 2 out of the 4 scheduled sessions - Monday's W25 went okay with about 50% weight modifications, and I pushed through Wednesday's W21 though I had to skip the last circuit entirely because I was just exhausted. Thursday I woke up planning to do W25 but my legs were so sore from Wednesday and I'd only slept 5.5 hours, so I convinced myself I'd do it Saturday instead. Saturday came and I just... didn't. I felt guilty but also relieved? Sunday's W21 never happened either - I spent most of the day meal prepping and catching up on errands.

The diet part was even messier. My hunger levels were through the roof this week, probably because of the poor sleep and stress at work. I stuck relatively close to the meal plan Monday and Tuesday, but by Wednesday I was adding snacks - an extra labneh cup here, some dates there, probably added 300-400 extra calories. Friday I completely gave up and ordered a chicken shawarma plate with fries (65 SAR - ouch). Saturday I met friends for brunch at a café and had eggs Benedict with a latte (52 SAR). Sunday I tried to get back on track but still went over by about 200 calories because I was stress-eating almonds while meal prepping.

My budget is a disaster - I spent around 285 SAR this week versus my 210 SAR target. The restaurant meals killed me financially, plus I had to replace some groceries I'd planned poorly. I'm really feeling the financial stress now.

Physically, I'm seeing the scale barely move despite feeling like I'm working so hard. My clothes fit slightly better around the waist but my energy is in the toilet. I had two really bad sleep nights (5.5 hours Thursday and 5 hours Saturday) which made everything worse. The DOMS from the two workouts I did was actually pretty intense - my quads were screaming Tuesday through Thursday.

I'm starting to wonder if this is sustainable. I feel like I'm constantly behind, constantly tired, constantly hungry, and constantly overspending. My protein intake was all over the place - some days I hit maybe 120g, other days barely 90g. I know that's not helping with muscle retention.

The bright side? I didn't completely give up. I showed up twice for workouts even when I didn't want to. I did meal prep on Sunday even though I was exhausted. I'm still here, still trying. But I need to figure something out because this level of struggle isn't working for me long-term."
P16,2025-W52,38.5,24.3,79.2,2785,6.3,"Week 52 was extremely challenging and honestly felt like a breaking point. Coming off W51's 45% adherence, I started Monday with cautious optimism but my body and mind were both exhausted. The cumulative fatigue from weeks of insufficient sleep (averaging 6.3 hours again) really caught up with me. I managed only 2 of the 4 scheduled workouts - completed W25 on Monday at about 60% intensity with major modifications, and pushed through W21 on Wednesday but had to stop after the second circuit. Thursday's W25 was skipped entirely because I woke up with intense DOMS in my quads and glutes that made stairs painful. Saturday's W21 never happened - I chose extra sleep over the workout after another brutal week at work.

Diet adherence was my worst yet, maybe 35-40%. The 2363 kcal target felt impossible to maintain with my energy levels so low. I added 300-500 extra calories on 6 out of 7 days, mostly from quick carbs and comfort foods. Had three major budget violations: Wednesday evening shawarma wrap (45 SAR), Friday takeout biryani (58 SAR), and Sunday family gathering where I couldn't control portions. My beginner cooking skills failed me this week - I burned rice twice and gave up on meal prep by Thursday. Budget catastrophe: spent approximately 315 SAR versus my 210 SAR target (50% overspend). The financial stress is now affecting my sleep quality even more.

Protein intake was inconsistent, probably 85-125g daily instead of the 177g target. I relied heavily on labneh, eggs, and whatever rotisserie chicken I could grab. Fiber was low too since I skipped most vegetable prep. Energy crashes every afternoon around 2-3 PM were debilitating. Two nights I only got 5.5 hours of sleep (Tuesday and Friday) which made everything exponentially harder. Motivation hit rock bottom at 3/10 by Saturday.

Physically, I noticed minimal changes. Maybe 0.3-0.4 kg weight loss but it could be water fluctuation. My clothes fit about the same. The persistent DOMS lasting 4+ days after workouts suggests I'm not recovering adequately with my current sleep and nutrition. I'm experiencing some frustration because I know my 55% adherence propensity should be higher, but the barriers are overwhelming right now. The beginner fitness level means every workout still feels brutally hard, and I haven't experienced that 'exercise high' people talk about.

Positive notes: I didn't quit entirely, which given the circumstances feels like a victory. I'm learning what doesn't work - unrealistic calorie targets when exhausted, complex meal prep with beginner skills, and 4 workouts weekly with insufficient recovery. I need to seriously reassess sustainability for W53. The 30 SAR daily budget is proving impossible with my current eating patterns and cooking limitations. I'm considering dropping to 3 workouts per week and focusing on sleep quality as the primary intervention."
P16,2026-W01,38.55,24.25,79,2680,6.2,"Week 1 of 2026 was incredibly difficult. I started with hope after the holiday break, thinking maybe I could reset, but reality hit hard. Monday's workout (W25) felt impossible - I modified almost everything and still couldn't finish the last set. My legs were shaking. Tuesday I woke up so sore I could barely walk down stairs. The DOMS was worse than last week somehow.

Diet was a disaster again. I tried meal prepping Sunday night but got overwhelmed and just made rice and boiled eggs. By Wednesday I was so tired of eggs I grabbed a shawarma wrap on the way home (cost me 42 SAR, couldn't help it). Thursday I was supposed to work out but my thighs were still burning and I just... couldn't. I felt so guilty but also so exhausted.

Friday was the worst - I had a terrible day at work, slept only 5 hours the night before, and ordered biryani. Another 55 SAR gone. I didn't even track it properly because I felt so defeated. Saturday's workout (W21) I actually showed up for, which felt like a victory, but I could only do about 50% intensity and skipped all the jump movements.

Sunday we had extended family over and I completely lost track of portions. There was kabsa, multiple desserts, and I was too embarrassed to weigh anything in front of everyone. I probably ate 3000+ calories easily.

My budget is destroyed again - I'm at about 290 SAR for the week when I should be at 210. That's 80 SAR over, and I still have to eat for 3 more days this month. I'm genuinely stressed about money now. Sleep averaged maybe 6.2 hours because I keep lying awake worried about finances and feeling like a failure.

The scale barely moved - maybe 0.2 kg down but honestly that could just be bathroom timing. I don't see any changes in the mirror. My clothes fit the same. I'm completing maybe 40% of what I'm supposed to do and getting maybe 10% of the results. 

I keep reading that beginners should see 'newbie gains' and feel energized but I just feel tired and sore all the time. No endorphins, no runner's high, nothing. Just pain and exhaustion. I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. Maybe my body just doesn't respond to exercise like other people's?

The only positive is I didn't quit completely. I showed up twice even though I wanted to stay in bed. That has to count for something, right? But I can't keep spending this much money. I need to figure out cheaper meals or I'll be in real financial trouble.

Motivation is maybe 4/10 - slightly better than last week's 3/10 only because it's a new year and I'm trying to hold onto that 'fresh start' feeling, but it's fading fast. I'm starting to think I need to completely redesign this plan or accept that I'm just not cut out for this fitness thing."
P16,2026-W02,38.65,24.15,78.7,2780,6,"Week 2 of 2026 was honestly a struggle, maybe even harder than Week 1. I came into this week already feeling burned out from the previous week's failures, and that New Year motivation I had? Completely gone. Monday's workout (W25) was scheduled and I did show up, but my body was still so sore from last week that I could barely manage 40% intensity. I modified almost everything - no jumping movements at all, used the lightest weights available, and took long breaks between sets. I felt weak and frustrated the entire time.

Diet-wise, I started Monday with good intentions. Made some boiled eggs and rice again, but by Tuesday I was already sick of eating the same bland food. Wednesday I caved and got a chicken shawarma wrap during lunch break (cost me 38 SAR, way over my daily budget). Thursday I was supposed to work out (W21) but I just couldn't. My legs were killing me, I'd only slept 5.5 hours, and I had a headache all day. I skipped it entirely.

Friday was my second workout attempt (W25 again), and I did go, but it was even worse than Monday. I managed maybe 35% intensity, stopped after 20 minutes because I felt dizzy and nauseous. I don't know if it was the lack of sleep, poor nutrition, or just being overtrained, but my body was screaming at me to stop. Saturday's W21 workout? Didn't happen. I slept in until 11am because I was so exhausted.

The weekend was a disaster financially and diet-wise. Saturday night I ordered biryani because I was too tired to cook (52 SAR, probably 1000+ calories). Sunday there was a family gathering and I completely gave up trying to track anything. I ate kabsa, multiple pieces of baklava, and drank sugary tea. I estimate I consumed at least 2800 calories that day, maybe more.

My sleep averaged around 6 hours again, with two really bad nights (Thursday and Friday) where I got barely 5 hours. I'm constantly tired, irritable, and I have zero energy. The workouts aren't giving me any endorphin boost - I just feel drained and sore afterward. I'm not seeing any changes in my body at all. My clothes fit the same, the scale barely moved (maybe down 0.3 kg but that could just be water weight or measurement error).

I spent about 285 SAR this week, which is way over my 210 SAR budget. The unplanned meals are killing my finances. I'm stressed about money, which makes me sleep worse, which makes me eat worse, which makes me feel guilty, which stresses me out more. It's a vicious cycle.

Protein intake was probably around 100-120g most days, nowhere near the 182g target. I'm just not hungry for more chicken and eggs, and I can't afford protein powder. Vegetables? Barely any. Fiber is definitely low.

Honestly, I'm starting to question if this is sustainable at all. I completed 2 out of 4 scheduled workouts, both at very low intensity with major modifications. My adherence was probably around 35-40% this week. I feel like I'm failing at everything - the workouts, the diet, the budget, even sleep. I don't see the point anymore when nothing is changing and I just feel worse every day.

The only tiny positive is that I didn't completely quit. I showed up twice, even though I did terribly. But that feels like a pretty low bar for success. I'm demotivated, exhausted, and seriously considering whether I should just stop trying so hard and accept that this isn't working for me right now."
P16,2026-W03,38.7,24.1,78.5,2680,6,"Week 3 was honestly a disaster and I'm questioning everything right now. I went into Monday feeling like maybe I could turn things around, but my body had other plans. The DOMS from last week still hadn't fully cleared, and I'm just so tired all the time. I managed to drag myself to two workouts this week, but calling them 'workouts' feels generous—they were more like me going through the motions while my body screamed at me to stop.

The diet situation got even worse. I tried to meal prep on Sunday night, but I was so exhausted that I only made it through prepping two meals before I gave up and ordered delivery. By Wednesday I was back to my old habits—grabbed a chicken shawarma wrap on the way home because I was starving and didn't have anything ready. Thursday I felt so guilty that I tried to 'make up for it' by eating less, but that just made me dizzy and irritable. Friday's workout was a joke—I had to stop after 15 minutes because I felt like I was going to pass out.

The weekend completely fell apart. Saturday I slept until noon trying to catch up on sleep, then ordered biryani because I felt too exhausted to cook. Sunday was a family gathering and I just said 'screw it' and ate everything—kabsa, multiple pieces of baklava, sweet tea. I probably ate 3000+ calories that day alone. I felt sick afterwards but also relieved to just not think about the diet for one day.

My budget is completely blown again—I spent almost 300 SAR this week because I kept ordering takeout when I was too tired to cook. The guilt about the money is almost worse than the guilt about the food. I'm supposed to be saving, and instead I'm spending more than ever and have nothing to show for it.

I'm only sleeping about 6 hours a night, sometimes less, and I wake up feeling like I never slept at all. The DOMS is still lasting 3-4 days after every workout, which means I'm basically always sore. I don't feel stronger or fitter—I just feel broken and exhausted. No endorphins, no 'workout high,' just pain and fatigue.

I've lost maybe 0.2 kg this week but I think that's just because I felt too nauseous to eat much on Thursday and Friday morning. My clothes fit exactly the same. I look in the mirror and see no changes at all after three weeks of suffering.

The worst part is the mental spiral. I feel like a complete failure. I can't stick to the diet, I can't complete the workouts, I can't manage my budget, I can't even get enough sleep. Every day I wake up planning to do better, and every day I fail. The stress is making me want to eat more, which makes me gain weight, which makes me more stressed. I'm trapped.

I completed maybe 30% of what I was supposed to do this week. Two half-hearted workouts out of four scheduled. Diet was a disaster 6 out of 7 days. I'm eating my feelings and my wallet is suffering too. My motivation is maybe 2/10 at this point—I'm basically only continuing because I feel like I've already invested three weeks and quitting would mean admitting total failure.

I don't know if I can keep doing this. The program feels impossible for someone at my fitness level. I'm a beginner trying to do intermediate workouts while running on 6 hours of sleep and a chaotic diet. Something has to change or I'm going to burn out completely. I need easier workouts, more realistic diet expectations, or maybe just to accept that this isn't the right time in my life for this kind of program.

The only positive is that I haven't completely given up yet, but I'm very, very close."
P16,2026-W04,39.2,24,79,2890,5.5,"Week 4 was honestly a disaster that somehow felt even worse than Week 3. I'm writing this Sunday night and I just feel completely defeated. I only made it to ONE workout this entire week - just one out of four scheduled. Monday I dragged myself to the gym and did maybe 20% of W25, stopped after 18 minutes because I felt like I was going to pass out. My legs were still sore from... I don't even remember what from anymore, everything just hurts all the time now.

I skipped Wednesday completely. I set my alarm, I had my gym clothes out, but when it went off I just turned it over and went back to sleep. I'm averaging like 5.5 hours a night and I'm so tired I can barely think straight at work. Thursday was supposed to be my 'get back on track' day but I worked until 8pm and then just went home and ordered pizza. The whole pizza. 65 SAR and probably 2000 calories. I didn't even enjoy it, I just ate it while staring at my phone.

Friday I didn't even pretend I was going to work out. Saturday I actually felt a bit better after sleeping until 11am, thought about going to the gym, laid out my clothes, then just... didn't. Made coffee, sat on the couch, and that was it. Sunday (today) I told myself I'd at least do SOMETHING but I had a family thing in the afternoon and ate way too much again - kabsa, multiple servings, desserts, the works. Probably 2800+ calories just at that meal.

The diet has been a complete joke. I'm not even tracking most days anymore because it's too depressing. I know I'm eating 2800-3500 calories most days. My budget is absolutely destroyed - I spent around 315 SAR this week, which is 50% over my limit. I'm stress-eating constantly, buying takeout because I'm too tired to cook, then feeling guilty, then eating more because I feel bad. It's this horrible cycle and I don't know how to break it.

I've gained back whatever tiny amount I lost last week, plus probably more. My clothes feel tighter. I look at myself in the mirror and I just see someone who's failing at everything. The worst part is I KNOW what I should be doing - eat less, move more, sleep better - but knowing doesn't help when you're this exhausted and stressed and just want to feel better for five minutes.

I think I need to seriously reconsider this whole thing. Maybe I'm just not ready. Maybe I need to fix my sleep first, or my stress, or something, because whatever I'm doing now is clearly not working. I'm more tired, more stressed, spending more money, and getting zero results. Actually, negative results - I'm heavier than when I started.

The only semi-positive thing is that I'm at least being honest about how bad this is instead of pretending it's fine. But that's a pretty low bar. I don't know what Week 5 is going to look like. Part of me wants to quit entirely, part of me feels like I should keep trying, and most of me just wants to sleep for about three days straight."
P16,2026-W05,39.4,23.9,79.3,2180,5.5,"Week 5 started with a glimmer of hope but ended in familiar territory. Monday I actually made it to the gym - first small win in weeks. Felt weak but completed W25 at maybe 35% intensity, had to modify everything but I SHOWED UP. Tuesday's diet was surprisingly okay, hit my targets mostly because I meal-prepped Sunday night during a rare motivated moment. 

Wednesday everything started unraveling. Overslept again (5 hours sleep), skipped the W21 workout, grabbed shawarma for lunch (didn't track it, maybe 800 kcal?). Thursday was supposed to be W25 but work crisis kept me until 7:30pm, came home exhausted, ordered chicken mandi (55 SAR - there goes my budget again). Ate way too much, felt sick and guilty.

Friday I rallied - did W21 at home, modified version, maybe 25 minutes. Felt accomplished but also highlighted how weak I still am. Can barely do proper push-ups. Saturday was a disaster - family gathering, ate everything, stopped tracking by 3pm. Kabsa, desserts, the works. Probably 2500+ kcal. Sunday tried to compensate by eating very little (maybe 1200 kcal?) which just made me irritable and set up Monday for another potential binge.

Completed 2 of 4 workouts this week - better than last week's 1, but still failing. Diet adherence maybe 40%? Three days were okay-ish, four were bad to terrible. Budget blown again at ~280 SAR (40% over). Sleep still catastrophic at 5.5 hours average - this is killing me but work demands won't let up.

The positive: I showed up twice for workouts. That's 100% improvement from last week. The negative: everything else. I'm exhausted, clothes are tighter, I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle. The workouts are still too hard - I modify everything and still feel destroyed. 

Honestly considering taking a full week off to just sleep and reset. Or maybe finding a beginner walking program instead. These HIIT/circuit workouts feel impossible with 5 hours of sleep. My body is screaming for rest but my mind is screaming that I'm failing. Caught between pushing through and admitting I need to change something fundamental.

Weight up slightly again. Not surprised. More disappointed than anything. At least I didn't quit completely this week?"
P16,2026-W06,39.7,23.8,79.7,1847,5.5,"Week 6 was honestly another struggle, but I'm trying to see the small positives. I managed 2 out of 4 workouts again - same as last week - which feels like I'm stuck in place rather than moving forward. The sleep situation is killing me; I'm still averaging around 5.5 hours and I can feel it in everything I do. My energy is just not there.

Monday's W25 workout was really hard. I showed up, which I'm proud of, but I could only do about 30% intensity and had to modify almost everything. I felt weak and shaky, and only made it through maybe 2 circuits in 20 minutes before I had to stop. My legs were trembling.

I skipped Wednesday's W21 because I overslept - only got 5 hours sleep Tuesday night and just couldn't drag myself out of bed. Then Thursday I was planning to do W25 but work ran late again until 7:45pm and I was just mentally done. I grabbed takeout on the way home instead.

Friday I did manage W21 at home, all modified - no jumping, wall push-ups, the whole beginner version. It took me 23 minutes and I was exhausted after, but I finished it. That felt like a win even though I know it wasn't the 'real' workout.

Diet-wise, I'm still struggling. I tracked most days but went over my calories on 4 days. Thursday's takeout was expensive (52 SAR) and probably 1700+ calories. Saturday was a family thing with kabsa and I just... stopped tracking after lunch. I know I ate way too much. Sunday I tried to 'make up for it' by barely eating (maybe 1100 calories?) but that just made me starving and irritable Monday.

I spent about 265 SAR this week on food, which is still over my 210 budget but better than the 280 last week. I'm trying. My protein is still low - maybe 85-95g most days. I'm just too tired to cook proper meals most nights.

The scale went up another 0.4 kg and my jeans are definitely tighter. I feel like I'm failing but I haven't quit yet. I'm seriously thinking about switching to just a walking program or something more realistic for where I'm actually at. These workouts feel impossible when I'm this tired and weak."
P16,2026-W07,39.9,23.7,80,1615,5.5,"Week 7 was honestly another struggle, but I'm seeing some tiny cracks of light. I managed 3 out of 4 workouts this week which is technically an improvement from my usual 2, though one was barely a workout. Sleep is still awful - I'm running on fumes most days and it's affecting everything. The diet was all over the place again. I had two really good days where I stuck close to my targets and actually felt proud of myself, but then Thursday happened - work stress led to another takeout disaster and I just... gave up for the rest of the evening. The weekend was better than last week though - I prepped some meals on Saturday which helped Sunday and Monday stay on track. My energy is still terrible and I'm so tired of feeling weak during workouts. I modified everything again but at least I showed up more often. The scale isn't moving the right direction and my jeans are still tight, which is really discouraging. I keep thinking about switching to just walking like I mentioned last week, but I'm trying to push through one more week to see if the extra workout day makes a difference. I'm exhausted and frustrated, but I haven't quit yet."
P16,2026-W08,40.2,23.65,80.7,1664,5.5,"Week 8 feels like I hit a wall made of exhaustion and reality checks. Started Monday with good intentions - actually did W25 at the gym, managed about 40% intensity for 26 minutes, 3.5 circuits. Felt slightly stronger than last week but still modifying everything. The chronic sleep debt is destroying me though - averaging 5.5 hours again, with Thursday night being absolutely brutal at 4 hours because of work stress.

Diet was a mixed bag, honestly probably worse than W07. Had two really good days (Monday and Friday, both around 1500 kcal), but Wednesday I stress-ate my way through 1850 kcal including spontaneous shawarma because I was too tired to cook. Saturday was the disaster - 1950 kcal, ordered pizza after another terrible sleep night, spent 52 SAR on that one meal alone. The guilt spiral started but I managed to pull it together Sunday with meal prep.

Completed 3 out of 4 workouts - skipped Sunday's W21 because I was absolutely wrecked from the week. Did Wednesday's W21 at home (bodyweight only, 23 minutes, heavy modifications), and Friday's W25 was probably my best effort at 45% intensity, 27 minutes, felt like my body remembered how to move a little bit.

Protein averaged maybe 95g daily, still way below target but I'm trying. Tracking stayed consistent all 7 days which feels like my one win. Budget went to 267 SAR (27% over target) - the Saturday binge really hurt financially too.

Weight went up another 0.4 kg. Jeans are definitely tighter. I can see this isn't working but I'm so tired I can't think straight about what to change. The walking program keeps calling to me but I told myself I'd try one more week of this. Energy is maybe 3/10, motivation hovering around 3/10. I'm showing up but I'm not thriving, just surviving.

Small positives: I didn't completely give up after Saturday's binge. Sunday meal prep happened even though I was exhausted. I made it to the gym twice. But honestly, I feel like I'm treading water in a pool that's slowly filling up. The 5.5 hours of sleep is killing everything else I'm trying to do."
P16,2026-W09,40.5,23.55,81.3,1715,5.5,"Week 9 was honestly a breaking point. I started Monday determined to turn things around after last week's disaster, but my body had other plans. The 5.5 hours of sleep is just destroying me - I'm walking around like a zombie most days. I managed to do W25 on Monday at maybe 50% intensity, but by Wednesday I was so exhausted I could barely get through W21 at home with bodyweight only. The weights felt like they weighed a thousand pounds.

The diet situation got even worse. I exceeded my calories 5 out of 7 days this week. Tuesday I stress-ate my way to 1820 calories after another terrible night's sleep. Thursday was the worst - I ordered shawarma and fries for 42 SAR because I was too tired to even think about cooking. Then Saturday happened... I had a complete meltdown and ordered KFC for 58 SAR. I ate until I felt sick. It was like I couldn't stop myself. The guilt afterwards was crushing.

I did manage to complete Friday's W25 workout at about 50% intensity, which felt like a small victory, but then skipped Sunday's W21 completely because I was just done. Physically and mentally done. I did force myself to do a minimal meal prep Sunday evening - just boiled some eggs and chicken - because I knew if I didn't, this week would be even worse.

My jeans are definitely tighter. I can feel it when I sit down. I'm gaining weight when I'm supposed to be losing it, and I'm so tired I can't even think clearly about how to fix it. I spent 297 SAR this week on food, which is 41% over budget. That Saturday binge alone was almost two days' worth of budget.

The worst part is I KNOW what I need to do - sleep more, eat better, be consistent - but knowing and doing are two completely different things when you're running on fumes. Work has been insane, and by the time I get home, I have zero energy left for anything. I'm starting to wonder if I should just quit the gym workouts entirely and try walking instead, but even that feels like admitting defeat.

I tracked everything this week, even the binges, which I guess is something. But tracking my failures doesn't make them any less real. My energy is at 2/10 most days. Motivation is maybe 2/10. I feel like I'm in a hole and I keep digging deeper. Something has to change, but I'm too exhausted to figure out what."

The meal plan was quite a lot of food - especially that 4th meal with dates and almonds, it felt like so many calories! I managed to stick to the shakshuka breakfast most days because it was tasty and filling. The gym workouts were really intense for my beginner level - the advanced upper body and legs sessions left me extremely sore. I could only complete about half the exercises properly and had to skip some days because of muscle soreness and fatigue. My low sleep (around 5-6 hours) made it harder to recover and stay motivated. I did my best on about 4 out of 7 days with the diet, but some evenings I was too tired to prepare the kofta meal and grabbed something simpler. The snacks were easy though.

The workouts were REALLY hard - I didn't realize 'Advanced' level would be so intense for someone at my beginner fitness level. I could only complete about half of the upper body workout and maybe 60% of the leg workout. My muscles were so sore I had to skip one planned workout day entirely. The 2489 calorie target felt like a lot of food, so on days I was busy or tired, I probably ate closer to 1800-2000 calories. My sleep didn't improve much - still struggling with that.

I did notice some initial water weight loss, probably from the low calories and increased activity, but I'm concerned this isn't sustainable long-term."

I managed to stick to it about 55% of the time, but on the other days I had to eat more because I felt dizzy and weak, especially with the advanced gym workouts. The foul medames breakfast was filling and I enjoyed it, but by mid-morning I was starving. The kabsa portion was tiny compared to what I'm used to. I found myself adding extra rice a few times just to function. The workouts were way too intense for my beginner fitness level - I couldn't complete most of the advanced exercises and had to modify or skip sets. My sleep didn't improve much because I was often hungry at night. I did lose some weight, which is encouraging, but I'm worried this isn't healthy or sustainable long-term."

I'm a beginner and this felt more like starvation than a healthy diet. I tried my best but with my 55% adherence tendency, I found myself adding extra portions at meals, especially at dinner when I felt lightheaded. The shakshuka breakfast was delicious and easy to make, which I loved. The chicken shawarma was tasty but took more prep than I expected with my beginner cooking skills. I struggled with the lentil soup - made it twice but it was bland. The workouts were way too advanced for my beginner fitness level. Upper body and legs at advanced level left me extremely sore for 3-4 days each time. I could only complete about half the exercises and had to use much lighter weights. My sleep didn't improve much - still averaging around 5.5 hours because of work stress. I did lose a bit of weight but I'm concerned this approach isn't healthy long-term. I felt tired and irritable most days."

The workouts labeled 'Advanced' were way too intense for my beginner fitness level - I could barely complete the upper body session and had to modify most exercises.

However, the advanced upper body and leg workouts at the gym were way too intense for my beginner fitness level - I couldn't complete most of the exercises with proper form and felt discouraged. I did show up to the gym 2 out of the planned 4 days because I was too tired and sore. My sleep didn't improve much because I was often hungry at night. I did notice my clothes fitting slightly better by the end of the week, which was motivating. I think I need a more realistic calorie target and workouts that match my actual fitness level."

I managed to stick to the diet about 55% of the time - some days I added extra portions because I was too hungry to function at work. The ful medames breakfast was filling and I enjoyed it, but by afternoon I was starving. The shrimp tabbouleh was tasty but took longer to prep than expected with my limited cooking skills. I only made it to the gym 2 out of the planned 4 days because the advanced upper body and leg workouts were way too intense for my beginner fitness level - I couldn't complete most exercises with proper form. My sleep actually got slightly worse, averaging around 5.2 hours because I was either too hungry to sleep well or too sore from the workouts.

I tried my best but my adherence was around 55% - some days I stuck closer to the plan, but other days I was so hungry I had to eat more, probably averaging around 1100-1200 kcal daily. The shakshuka breakfast was delicious and easy to make, which I loved. The chicken shawarma wrap was tasty but took more prep than I expected with my beginner cooking skills. I often simplified it or grabbed something quicker. The workouts were way too advanced for my beginner fitness level - I felt completely overwhelmed in the gym and couldn't complete most exercises properly. I modified them significantly and only made it to the gym 2 days instead of 4. My energy was very low all week, probably from the calorie restriction and poor sleep. I'm still only getting about 5 hours of sleep because of work stress. I did notice feeling slightly less bloated by the end of the week, and my clothes fit a tiny bit better.

P17,2025-W46,26.6,33.2,88.1,2050,7,"This week was challenging but I managed to stick with it about 60% of the time. The ful medames breakfast became my favorite - easy to prepare and kept me full. I struggled with the advanced workouts though, being a beginner they were really tough. Had to reduce weights significantly on the pull day and couldn't complete all sets on legs day. The kabsa for lunch was delicious but took longer to prepare than expected, so I skipped it twice and had shawarma instead. The jareesh dinner was filling but bland - need to figure out better seasoning. My energy levels improved mid-week but I felt sore after each gym session. Sleep was decent around 7 hours most nights, though I stayed up late two nights watching football. Overall, I'm proud I showed up to the gym three times even though the workouts were above my level."
P17,2025-W47,26.3,33.4,87.8,2720,7.2,"This week was a mixed bag, honestly. I started strong on Monday and Tuesday, following the meal plan pretty closely and feeling motivated after my workouts. The soreness from the leg day (W21) was intense - I had to take the stairs really slowly at work on Wednesday! By mid-week, I started feeling the fatigue from trying to hit those calorie targets while keeping my budget in check. Thursday I grabbed some shawarma instead of cooking because I was exhausted after work, and Friday I just didn't have the energy to meal prep properly. The workouts themselves were challenging - I had to drop the weights significantly from what the programs suggested since I'm still building my base strength. Saturday's upper body session (W33) left my shoulders and chest pretty sore. I did notice I'm sleeping a bit better, probably from the physical activity. The appetite increase is real - I'm hungry all the time now, especially in the evenings. I managed to stay mostly on track with protein thanks to the laban and chicken, but some days I definitely went over on fats when I added extra olive oil or grabbed convenience foods. Overall, I'd say I hit about 55-60% adherence this week, which feels realistic given my schedule and cooking limitations."
P17,2025-W48,26.1,33.5,87.4,2510,7.1,"Week 48 complete. Started Monday motivated after last week's reflections, but the pattern repeated itself - strong start, mid-week struggles, decent finish. The prescribed diet at nearly 3000 kcal felt overwhelming given my beginner cooking skills and budget constraints. I managed roughly 55-60% adherence this week.

Monday and Tuesday were solid - followed the meal plan closely, prepped chicken and rice in bulk. The high calorie target is challenging to hit with whole foods on my budget. Wednesday hit hard with work exhaustion and I grabbed a quick shawarma (35 SAR) instead of cooking. Thursday and Friday saw me eating simpler meals - eggs, bread, laban, dates - undereating the target by 400-500 kcal both days.

Completed all 3 workouts again (W33 upper, W29 full body, W21 lower body). Still using reduced weights but pushed slightly harder than last week - maybe 75% of prescribed loads instead of 70%. The leg workout on Saturday absolutely destroyed me. Sunday I could barely walk down stairs. This delayed-onset soreness is no joke at 50+ years old.

Budget pressure was real this week. Spent about 320 SAR total (45.7 SAR/day average), which is slightly over. The protein requirements are expensive - chicken breast, eggs, and laban add up quickly. Had to skip some of the prescribed snacks and fruits.

Sleep averaged around 7.1 hours - slightly down from last week due to muscle soreness disrupting sleep quality, especially Sunday night after the brutal leg session. Woke up multiple times to shift position.

Positives: I'm getting better at the workout movements, even if the weights are light. My appetite has increased noticeably, which makes sense with the training. I can feel myself getting slightly stronger - the upper body workout felt less awkward.

Challenges: The cooking time commitment is real. Between work fatigue and limited kitchen skills, I'm defaulting to simpler meals mid-week. The 3000 kcal target feels too high for my actual activity level and budget. I'm hungry post-workout but struggle to eat enough quality food. The muscle soreness is affecting my daily function - climbing stairs, sitting down, even driving feels uncomfortable for 2-3 days after leg day.

Body changes: Minimal visible difference, but I feel slightly 'tighter' around my core. Weight is stable, maybe down 0.3-0.4 kg but that could be water fluctuation. No dramatic changes expected after just 2 weeks, but the consistency is building slowly."
P17,2025-W49,25.7,33.7,86.9,2650,7.2,"Week 49 was challenging but I pushed through better than last week. Started Monday still sore from that brutal leg workout, but the pain finally subsided by Wednesday. I managed to stick closer to the meal plan this week - hitting about 65% adherence overall, which is an improvement. The budget worked out to around 43 SAR per day, so I stayed within limits. I completed all three workouts (W33, W29, W21) but had to modify W21 again because my legs were still remembering last week's punishment. I'd say I worked at about 75-80% intensity across the board. Sleep was better mid-week (7.5 hours average) but dropped off on workout days. The protein target is still hard to hit consistently - I averaged maybe 160g per day instead of 188g. My cooking skills are slowly improving; I meal-prepped chicken and rice twice this week which saved money and helped with consistency. Thursday I caved and got a chicken shawarma after work because I was exhausted and hungry. The scale shows a small drop which is encouraging, and I feel like my shirts are fitting slightly better around the chest and shoulders. Recovery is still taking longer than I'd like - I'm 52, not 25 anymore. The hunger after workouts is real, and I'm learning to time my meals better. Overall, this felt like a small win compared to Week 48."
P17,2025-W50,25.4,33.9,86.5,2700,7.3,"Week 50 was a mixed bag but overall decent progress considering the circumstances. Started strong with good adherence Monday through Wednesday, hitting around 85% of my diet targets and completing W33 on Monday with solid intensity. The cardio intervals felt noticeably easier than previous weeks - I could maintain the prescribed pace without feeling completely wrecked afterward, which is encouraging.

Thursday hit me hard though. Work stress combined with poor sleep Wednesday night (only 6.5 hours) meant I grabbed another shawarma for lunch - second week in a row. I'm noticing a pattern where mid-week fatigue leads to convenience eating. Need to prep grab-and-go options for these moments. Still managed W29 workout Thursday evening but had to drop weights by 5kg on overhead press due to fatigue.

Friday I was dragging from accumulated tiredness. Diet was maybe 70% on target - protein was short by about 40g. Skipped my usual evening snack and just crashed early. Saturday's W21 leg workout was surprisingly good despite the week's ups and downs. Increased squat weight by 5kg and managed all prescribed sets, though the last two were grinders. DOMS hit hard Sunday and Monday - walking downstairs was comical.

Meal prep Sunday worked well again. Made a big batch of chicken, rice, and roasted vegetables that covered Monday-Wednesday lunches. This is becoming my reliable cost-saving strategy. Spent about 38 SAR/day this week, staying under budget even with the Thursday slip-up.

Sleep averaged slightly better this week at 7.3 hours, though workout nights still disrupted. I'm trying to finish workouts by 7 PM instead of 8 PM which seems to help. Weight is trending down very slowly but muscle mass holding steady or maybe up slightly - exactly what I want for recomp. The scale frustrates me sometimes because changes are so gradual, but measurements and how clothes fit tell a better story.

Biggest win: cardio endurance improvement is real and noticeable. Biggest challenge: mid-week energy management and avoiding convenience food when tired. For next week, I'm going to prep some protein-rich snacks (boiled eggs, cheese portions) for the Thursday danger zone."
P17,2025-W51,25.1,34.1,86.2,2750,7.2,"Week 51 was a mixed bag, honestly. Started strong with good momentum from last week's improvements, but hit the usual mid-week wall around Thursday. The increased calorie target (2866 vs previous 2965 - wait, that's actually lower?) felt more manageable, and I hit closer to target most days. Completed all three workouts again, which I'm proud of, though W29 on Wednesday was brutal after Tuesday's leg DOMS hadn't fully cleared. 

Meal prep on Sunday went well - made a big batch of chicken and rice again, portioned out for Monday-Wednesday. Thursday I caved and grabbed a chicken bowl from a local spot (about 55 SAR) because I was too wiped to cook. Friday and Saturday I cobbled together simpler meals - eggs, canned tuna, bread, some vegetables. Not perfect macros but kept calories reasonable.

The workouts: Monday's W33 intervals felt strong, hit about 90% intensity. Legs were shaking but cardiovascular endurance is definitely improving - I'm not gasping for air like I was a month ago. Tuesday's W29 started okay but fatigue hit hard in the second half, probably 70% intensity overall. Had to drop weight on the overhead press by 2.5kg. Thursday's W21 was surprisingly decent despite mid-week tiredness - managed 85% intensity, even added 5kg to the deadlift which felt good.

DOMS pattern continues: severe Days 1-2 after legs (Monday workout), then manageable by Thursday. This affected Wednesday's workout performance. Sleep averaged around 7.2 hours - slightly down from last week's 7.3, had trouble falling asleep Tuesday and Friday nights, probably stress-related.

Budget came in at about 285 SAR for the week (40.7 SAR/day average), slightly over my 45 SAR/day limit but the Thursday meal pushed it up. Without that I'd have been around 230 SAR. Weight feels slightly down, clothes fitting a tiny bit better around the waist. Energy levels moderate - good Monday-Tuesday, dip Wednesday-Friday, recovered Saturday-Sunday.

Protein intake was better this week - averaged maybe 175-180g daily, closer to the 190g target. Carbs were consistently around 300-320g. Fat probably around 90-100g most days. Fiber still a weak point, maybe 25g average.

Barriers this week: mid-week fatigue remains the biggest issue. Thursday I almost skipped the workout but pushed through. Work stress was higher than usual Wednesday-Friday which affected sleep and meal planning. Recovery still feels slow but incrementally better than previous weeks.

Positives: consistency with workouts (3/3 again), better protein intake, noticeable cardiovascular improvements, no injuries, meal prep discipline on Sunday. The recomposition goal feels like it's slowly happening - strength is up slightly, waist feels marginally smaller, though scale weight hasn't moved dramatically.

Next week I need to figure out a better Thursday strategy - maybe prep an extra easy meal or have backup options ready. Also need to prioritize sleep Tuesday and Friday nights specifically."
P17,2025-W52,24.9,34.2,86,2700,7,"Week 52 was a mixed bag, honestly. Started strong with meal prep on Sunday which carried me through the first half of the week, but momentum faded as work pressures mounted mid-week. Completed all three workouts which I'm proud of, though W29 on Wednesday felt particularly brutal with lingering fatigue from Monday's W33 session. The DOMS from that first workout were intense - definitely felt it in my quads and shoulders for a solid 48 hours.

Diet adherence was around 60% this week, slightly down from Week 51's 65%. Monday and Tuesday were solid at about 80% compliance, hitting close to my protein targets with the prepped meals. Wednesday through Friday were rougher - work stress peaked, I grabbed a shawarma meal on Thursday (around 60 SAR, which hurt the budget), and portion control slipped at dinner a couple nights. Weekend rebounded a bit - Saturday was decent at 75%, and I did another meal prep Sunday to set up for the new year.

Calorie intake averaged around 2650-2750 daily, so slightly under target but not terrible. Protein was inconsistent - hit 180-185g on good days but dropped to 150-160g on the weaker days. Still struggling with fiber intake, probably averaging 23-25g instead of the 30g target. Need to add more vegetables and maybe some beans.

Workouts: W33 on Monday was challenging but I pushed through at about 85% intensity. The cardiovascular portions are getting easier which is encouraging. W29 on Wednesday was tough - only managed about 65% intensity due to residual soreness and mid-week fatigue. Had to reduce the overhead press weight by 2.5kg. W21 on Saturday felt better, around 80% intensity, and I maintained the deadlift weight from last week rather than adding more.

Sleep averaged 7.0 hours this week, down from 7.2. Had trouble falling asleep Sunday, Wednesday, and Thursday nights - mind racing about year-end work deadlines. This definitely impacted recovery and energy levels.

Budget came in at about 295 SAR (42.1 SAR/day), slightly over due to that Thursday convenience meal and some extra grocery items. The meal prep strategy helps a lot when I stick to it.

Positives: Completed all workouts despite fatigue, noticed my endurance is improving, and I think my waist is looking a bit trimmer - pants feel slightly looser. The scale barely moved but I'm trying to focus on body composition over just weight.

Challenges: Mid-week stress eating, inconsistent protein intake, sleep quality needs improvement, and I need to plan better for those chaotic work days. The holiday season and year-end pressure definitely didn't help.

Going into the new year, I want to focus on: 1) Better stress management strategies, 2) More consistent meal prep, 3) Adding a fiber supplement or more legumes to hit that 30g target, and 4) A wind-down routine before bed to improve sleep quality. Overall, not my best week but not a disaster either. Consistency is the goal."
P17,2026-W01,24.6,34.3,85.7,2750,6.7,"Week 1 of 2026 was a mixed bag. Started strong with good meal prep on Sunday which helped Monday and Tuesday adherence. The W33 workout on Monday was brutal - I'm still getting used to the intensity and had severe DOMS through Wednesday. That definitely impacted my Wednesday W29 session where I had to drop the overhead press weight again. Mid-week was rough - work stress picked up with Q1 planning meetings, sleep suffered Wednesday and Thursday nights (only got about 6 hours each), and I ended up grabbing a quick shawarma meal Thursday evening when I worked late. Friday I was dragging and skipped my usual evening walk.

The weekend was better. Saturday's W21 workout felt strong at about 80% intensity, and I managed to get my meal prep done Sunday despite feeling tired. Diet-wise, I hit my targets Monday and Tuesday (around 80% compliance), but Wednesday through Friday were more like 60-65% - too much snacking on dates and nuts when tired, and portions were larger than planned. Protein intake was okay, averaging maybe 170g, but I'm still not getting enough fiber (probably 24-25g daily). Weekend was better, back to 75% compliance.

Budget came in around 300 SAR for the week (42.9 SAR/day) - that Thursday shawarma meal cost me 60 SAR which threw things off. Positively, I'm noticing my pants fit a bit better around the waist, so something is working. Energy levels were inconsistent - good early week, terrible mid-week, recovered weekend. I need to figure out better stress management and sleep strategies for those mid-week slumps."
P17,2026-W02,24.3,34.5,85.4,2850,6.6,"Week 2 was definitely harder than Week 1. I started strong on Monday with good energy and nailed my W33 workout at about 85% intensity again. Felt confident after last week's progress. Tuesday I stuck to the meal prep pretty well, hit around 2850 kcal with solid protein (180g). But Wednesday hit me like a truck - combination of residual soreness from Monday's workout and work ramping up again. The W29 workout on Wednesday was rough; I had to drop weight on several exercises and only managed about 70% intensity. My sleep took a hit Wednesday night (only 6.2 hours) due to work emails keeping me up.

Thursday and Friday were survival mode. Diet compliance dropped to around 55-60% - I ended up grabbing a shawarma wrap on Thursday (about 65 SAR, over budget) because I didn't have time to prep, and Friday I just felt exhausted and overate by about 400 kcal, going up to 3200. The lack of sleep is really catching up with me - averaged only 6.3 hours mid-week. I'm 45 and I can feel it when I don't get enough rest.

Saturday's W21 workout was moderate - maybe 75% effort. I could tell my recovery wasn't complete. Legs felt heavy during squats. Sunday I did meal prep again which helped me feel more in control, and I got a better night's sleep (7.1 hours) which was much needed. 

Diet-wise, I averaged around 2850 kcal for the week, a bit under target. Protein was decent at 170-178g most days, but I definitely missed the fiber target mid-week (only 18-20g Wed-Fri). Budget came in at 315 SAR for the week (45/day), slightly over due to that Thursday slip-up.

Positives: I'm noticing my pants fit a bit better around the waist, and I think I'm seeing a tiny bit more definition in my shoulders. The scale barely moved but I feel like something is shifting composition-wise. Negatives: Sleep and work stress are my biggest enemies right now. When I'm tired, my adherence just tanks. I need to figure out how to protect my sleep better, especially mid-week.

Overall adherence: Workouts 3/3 completed but at reduced intensity (77% avg). Diet about 65% compliant. I'm sticking with it but this week felt like a grind."
P17,2026-W03,24.1,34.6,85.1,2920,6.6,"Week 3 presented a mixed bag of progress and challenges. Started strong Monday with good energy and solid workout execution (W33 at 80%), maintaining the momentum from Week 2's end. Tuesday's diet compliance was excellent at 85%, benefiting from Sunday meal prep. However, Wednesday brought familiar mid-week fatigue - the W29 workout felt harder than expected, managing only 65% intensity due to cumulative sleep debt and work pressures mounting again. Sleep Wednesday through Friday averaged only 6.3 hours, significantly impacting recovery and food choices. Thursday was particularly rough - skipped planned meals twice, ended up with a 72 SAR takeout dinner that blew the budget, and felt mentally foggy all day. Friday's diet compliance dropped to 50% as I relied on convenience foods. The weekend provided recovery: Saturday's W21 workout at 78% felt surprisingly good after catching up on sleep Friday night (7.1 hours). Sunday meal prep was only partially completed due to fatigue, which concerns me for next week. DOMS was moderate Monday-Tuesday, minimal rest of week. Positive notes: waist continues to feel slightly smaller, and I'm noticing better form on exercises despite lower intensity some days. Protein intake averaged 172g (below 185g target), fiber remained low at 21g mid-week. Total weekly spend was 328 SAR (46.9/day average), over budget by 13 SAR due to Thursday's meal. The pattern is clear: sleep quality directly predicts next-day adherence. When I get 7+ hours, everything clicks; under 6.5 hours, discipline crumbles. Week 3 feels like I'm plateauing rather than progressing, which is frustrating but probably normal for a beginner in week 3."
P17,2026-W04,23.8,34.8,84.8,2880,6.8,"Week 4 felt like a continuation of the adaptation struggle from Week 3, but with some strategic improvements. I deliberately focused on earlier bedtimes after recognizing the sleep-adherence correlation, and it paid off somewhat - I managed 6.8 hours average this week versus 6.6 last week. Monday started strong with good energy and I hit W33 at 82% intensity, feeling confident. Tuesday's diet compliance was solid at 84%, and I meal-prepped some basics which helped. Wednesday's W29 workout was tough again - only managed 68% intensity due to accumulated fatigue, but I pushed through rather than skipping. The mid-week crash pattern showed up again Thursday-Friday with diet adherence dropping to 52% and 54% respectively. Work stress peaked Thursday with back-to-back meetings, and I ended up ordering takeout (68 SAR) which blew my daily budget. Friday I was mentally exhausted and just couldn't bring myself to cook properly. Saturday's W21 session was surprisingly good at 80% - the weekend rest helped tremendously. I also got back on track with meal prep Sunday afternoon, prepping for the week ahead. Diet-wise, I averaged around 2880 kcal daily with protein ranging 170-178g, which is slightly over target but not terrible. Fiber was consistently 21-24g. Budget came to 322 SAR (46/day), so 7 SAR over but better than last week. The waist measurement continues to feel slightly looser, and I'm noticing better form on exercises like squats and rows. DOMS was moderate Monday-Tuesday only. The Thursday-Friday adherence crash is clearly my pattern now - it's when work stress, sleep debt, and decision fatigue all converge. I need to pre-plan those days better with ultra-simple meals. Overall, completing all 3 workouts again feels like a win, and the slight improvement in sleep is encouraging. Body composition changes are subtle but trending positive."
P17,2026-W05,23.5,35,84.3,2795,6.79,"Week 5 felt like a real test of consistency. Started strong Monday with W33 workout hitting 85% intensity - legs were burning but I pushed through all sets. Diet was on point Monday at 88% compliance, meal prep from Sunday carried me through. Tuesday's sleep dipped to 6.5 hours due to work stress, felt it during the day but managed 82% diet adherence.

Wednesday's W29 workout was tough - only managed 71% intensity, shoulders fatigued quickly. The mid-week slump hit hard Thursday with just 58% diet compliance and 6.3 hours sleep. Grabbed a shawarma meal (62 SAR) that wasn't planned, putting budget pressure on again. Friday was marginally better at 63% compliance but energy remained low with only 6.4 hours sleep.

Turning point came Saturday - slept 7.4 hours, felt refreshed, and crushed the W21 workout at 83% intensity. Waist definitely feels looser, had to adjust my belt one notch. Sunday's meal prep session went smoothly, hit 84% diet compliance. 

Physically, I'm noticing better form on squats and pushups. The DOMS is less severe now, recovery seems faster. Weight trending down slightly but I can see more definition in my arms and shoulders. The Thursday-Friday vulnerability window remains my Achilles heel - need to pre-pack Thursday lunch to avoid impulse purchases.

Motivation oscillated wildly: high Mon-Tue (8/10), crashed Wed-Fri (4-5/10), rebounded Sat-Sun (8/10). The correlation between sleep and adherence is undeniable. When I get 7+ hours, everything clicks. Budget came in at 328 SAR (46.86/day), over by 13 SAR mainly due to Thursday's unplanned meal. Protein intake solid at 172-180g daily, fiber averaging 23g. Next week I'm setting a phone reminder for Thursday morning meal prep check."
P17,2026-W06,23.1,35.3,84,2821,6.79,"Week 6 presented familiar challenges with mid-week adherence dips, but I managed to maintain consistency where it counted most. Monday started strong with excellent sleep carryover from the weekend - 7.2 hours gave me the energy to tackle W33 workout at 87% intensity, and diet compliance hit 86%. The momentum continued Tuesday with 84% diet adherence despite work pressures creeping in. Wednesday was the turning point - sleep dropped to 6.4 hours and I felt the familiar fatigue setting in during the W29 workout, completing it at 74% intensity. I had to reduce weight on squats by 5kg to maintain form. Thursday became my critical intervention day again - I stuck to my meal prep plan this time, avoiding the shawarma trap from last week, which kept me at 64% compliance (better than Week 5's 58%). Friday remained challenging at 67% diet adherence, but I pushed through knowing Saturday's workout was coming. The weekend recovery pattern held true: Saturday's W21 workout felt solid at 81% intensity after 7.3 hours sleep, and Sunday's meal prep session set me up well. My belt is now consistently on the tighter notch, and I'm noticing definition in my shoulders that wasn't there before. The scale shows modest changes, but the mirror and how my clothes fit tell a better story. Energy levels still correlate directly with sleep - anything under 6.5 hours and I'm dragging by afternoon. Budget management was much better this week at 43.2 SAR/day, staying well under my 45 SAR limit. The Thursday meal prep discipline was the game-changer. Recovery between workouts feels faster, and DOMS is less severe now. My body is adapting to the training stimulus, which is encouraging at my age."
P17,2026-W07,22.8,35.5,83.7,2843,6.79,"Week 7 felt like a continuation of the positive momentum from Week 6, with some expected mid-week challenges. Completed all 3 scheduled workouts (W33 Monday, W29 Wednesday, W21 Saturday) with good intensity. Monday's W33 session was strong—felt energized coming off the weekend and hit 89% adherence with solid form on compound movements. Wednesday's W29 was tougher; work stress carried over from Tuesday and I felt the cumulative fatigue, managing about 76% adherence with slightly reduced load on the final squat sets. Saturday's W21 was excellent at 84%—well-rested and motivated, noticed continued improvement in squat depth and deadlift lockout.

Diet adherence averaged 77% for the week, maintaining the upward trend. Monday and Sunday were strong at 87% and 83% respectively. Tuesday-Friday showed the familiar mid-week dip: Tuesday 82%, Wednesday 73%, Thursday 66%, Friday 69%, Saturday 81%. Thursday's meal prep strategy worked again—prepped chicken and rice Wednesday night which prevented the usual Thursday collapse, though I still went slightly over budget with an unplanned protein shake. Friday remained vulnerable due to accumulated work fatigue and shorter sleep Thursday night.

Sleep averaged 6.79 hours (unchanged from Week 6): Mon 7.1, Tue 6.9, Wed 6.5, Thu 6.3, Fri 6.6, Sat 7.4, Sun 7.0. The mid-week sleep debt (Wed-Fri) continues to impact energy and adherence. I'm noticing the pattern clearly now—when sleep drops below 6.5 hours, my discipline weakens significantly the next day.

Budget came in at 308 SAR (44.00/day), slightly over my 315 SAR weekly target but well-managed. The unplanned protein shake Thursday (22 SAR) and an extra carton of eggs Saturday (18 SAR) pushed me up, but I compensated by using leftovers more strategically.

Physical changes: Belt notch holding steady at the new position. Shoulder definition continues to improve—I can see striations when flexing now. Traps and upper back looking fuller. Squat form breakthrough this week—finally hitting parallel consistently without knee cave. Deadlifts feeling more natural, better hip hinge pattern. DOMS was moderate Monday-Tuesday (upper body focused), minimal Wednesday-Friday, mild Saturday evening (legs).

Energy levels: High Monday and weekend, moderate Tuesday-Wednesday, low Thursday-Friday. The sleep-energy-adherence connection is undeniable. Recovery between sessions feels faster than Weeks 4-5—adaptation is happening.

Challenges: Thursday-Friday remain the weak points despite interventions. Work stress Tuesday was higher than usual (project deadline), which affected Wednesday's workout quality. Friday evening I was tempted to skip meal prep for the weekend but pushed through—paid off with better Saturday/Sunday adherence.

Wins: Three workouts completed with good overall quality. Diet adherence holding above 75% for second consecutive week. Visible body composition changes (shoulders, upper back, waist). Improved movement patterns in squats and deadlifts. Budget management successful despite minor overages. Meal prep discipline maintained on critical days.

Body composition: Scale weight down slightly (0.3 kg), but mirror and measurements tell a better story—waist circumference down approximately 1 cm based on belt fit, upper body looking fuller. Muscle definition emerging in shoulders and arms. Face looking leaner. Likely gained small amount of muscle while losing fat, classic recomposition pattern.

Mood and motivation: Generally positive. Motivation pattern consistent with previous weeks—high weekends/Monday, dips mid-week, recovers Saturday. Feeling encouraged by visible changes and performance improvements. The grind of mid-week adherence is frustrating but manageable.

Looking ahead: Need to address Thursday-Friday sleep debt—considering earlier bedtime Wednesday and Thursday (target 10:30 PM vs current 11:15 PM). Will continue Thursday meal prep as it's proven effective. May need to adjust Friday expectations—accept 65-70% adherence as baseline and focus on not going below that threshold. Overall trajectory is positive and sustainable."
P17,2026-W08,22.5,35.7,83.5,2867,6.8,"Week 8 started strong with Monday's W33 workout hitting 91% intensity - felt powerful on compound lifts, especially squats where parallel depth is now automatic. Sleep Sunday night was solid at 7.2hrs which made a huge difference. Tuesday's diet compliance slipped to 71% due to unexpected late meeting - grabbed shawarma (85 SAR total spent, way over daily budget) but at least hit protein target at 182g. Wednesday's W29 workout was tough at 73% - only got 6.2hrs sleep Tuesday night and felt it in my legs during lunges. Work stress lower this week thankfully.

Thursday meal prep session saved me again - prepped chicken, rice, and veggies for Thu-Fri-Sat. Compliance jumped to 79% Thursday. Friday felt sluggish (6.4hrs sleep) but stuck to meal prep, hit 81% compliance. Saturday's W21 workout was excellent at 87% - DOMS from Monday finally gone, felt fresh, added 2.5kg to deadlift and form stayed tight. Sleep caught up Saturday night at 7.5hrs.

Sunday recovery day, compliance 85%, total weekly average 79% (+2% vs Week 7). Budget disaster mid-week but compensated with lentils and eggs Thu-Sun, ended at 326 SAR (46.57/day, over by 26 SAR). The Tuesday shawarma mistake hurt but I'm not beating myself up - life happens.

Physical changes continuing: shoulders looking fuller in mirror, wife commented my face looks leaner. Belt still same notch but pants fitting looser in waist, tighter in thighs. Squat form breakthrough feels amazing - hitting depth without thinking about it now. Energy pattern clear: under 6.5hrs sleep = struggle, over 6.8hrs = strong performance.

Minor knee twinge Saturday during jump squats but went away with stretching. DOMS pattern: Mon-Tue moderate, Wed-Thu minimal, Fri-Sat mild, Sun none. Motivation remains high, especially seeing visible changes. The recomposition is real - scale barely moving but body changing noticeably. Need to tighten budget discipline and protect sleep better mid-week."
P17,2026-W09,22,36.1,83.2,2847,6.76,"Week 9 complete! Started strong Monday with W33 workout - felt powerful, hit 95% adherence on the session. Squat depth is locked in now, feels natural. Diet was solid at 87% - meal prep Sunday really paid off. Sleep was decent at 7.1 hours, woke up refreshed.

Tuesday was a rest day, stuck to the plan at 83% compliance. Had a work presentation that ran late, grabbed pre-prepped chicken and rice which saved me from ordering out. Energy good throughout the day.

Wednesday hit W29 - this one's always challenging. Completed 89% despite some lingering fatigue in legs from Monday's squats. Sleep dipped to 6.3 hours Tuesday night due to neighbor noise, felt it during the workout. Diet 76% - had to substitute quinoa for rice (store was out), added extra olive oil which bumped calories slightly.

Thursday was my meal prep anchor day again. Spent 90 minutes cooking - chicken breast, brown rice, roasted vegetables, boiled eggs. This rhythm is really working. Diet 81%, sleep recovered to 6.9 hours. Noticed my work pants are looser in the waist.

Friday rest day, diet compliance 79%. Had a social coffee meeting, resisted the pastries but had a cappuccino (not in plan, ~80 kcal). Sleep 6.5 hours - right at that threshold where I feel it the next day.

Saturday crushed W21! 92% workout adherence, felt explosive. The shoulder definition is really showing now - caught myself flexing in the gym mirror. Diet 88%, added an extra banana post-workout for the carbs. Sleep Friday night was rough at 6.1 hours, but adrenaline carried me through.

Sunday recovery day, diet 84%. Took a 30-minute walk in the evening, felt good to move without intensity. Meal prepped again for the week ahead. Sleep caught up at 7.4 hours - body needed it.

Overall: 3/3 workouts completed with high quality. Diet averaged 82.6% (up 3.6% from Week 8!). Budget came in at 312 SAR (44.57/day) - stayed under this time by skipping the shawarma temptation and using more lentils/eggs. The Thursday meal prep is the MVP of my week.

Physical changes: Belt is on the next notch now (total ~2cm waist loss since Week 6). Shoulders have visible striations even at rest. Face definitely leaner - got comments from two colleagues. Scale only down 0.3kg but the mirror tells a different story - clear recomposition happening. Upper body feels fuller, especially chest and shoulders.

Sleep averaged 6.76 hours (down 0.04 from Week 8 but still in range). The 6.5-hour threshold is real - anything below that and I feel it in energy and recovery. Need to protect that Tuesday/Friday sleep better.

DOMS: Moderate Monday-Tuesday from squats, mild Wednesday-Thursday, minimal Friday-Sunday. Recovery is getting faster. No injuries, knee feels solid after last week's minor twinge.

Motivation remains high. The visual changes are incredibly reinforcing. Deadlift went up another 2.5kg Saturday. Squat form is automatic now. I'm starting to feel athletic again, not just 'working out.'

Challenges: Mid-week sleep dips are the main barrier. Work stress was moderate this week (one late meeting). Budget discipline improved - the meal prep system is both cheaper and better for adherence.

Next week: Focus on protecting sleep Tuesday/Friday nights. Maybe try magnesium before bed. Keep the Thursday meal prep anchor. Consider adding a fourth workout day if recovery continues improving, but not rushing it. The recomposition is accelerating - trust the process."

The workouts were honestly too advanced for my beginner fitness level - I had to scale back the weights significantly and couldn't complete all the sets on the Pull and Push days. The Legs workout left me very sore for 3 days. On the diet side, I followed the meal plan on weekdays pretty well, but weekends were harder. The shakshuka breakfast was great and easy to make, but the Chicken Mandi took longer than expected so I simplified it twice. I skipped the hummus snack a few times when I was busy at work. My energy levels improved mid-week, but I'm still not sleeping enough due to work stress. I can feel some initial changes - less bloating and my clothes fit slightly better.

I ended up adding extra portions a few times, particularly more rice with the Kabsa and an extra snack here and there. The foul medames breakfast was filling and I actually enjoyed it. The gym workouts were intense - being labeled 'Advanced' when I'm a beginner was tough. I could only complete about half the exercises at lower weights and had to skip some movements entirely. My legs were extremely sore after the first leg day. Sleep remained about the same, around 6-7 hours most nights due to work stress.

The advanced workouts were too intense for my beginner fitness level - I had to reduce weights significantly and couldn't complete all sets. I added extra snacks most days (nuts, fruits) because the calorie target seemed way too low for my activity level and goals. Sleep remained poor due to hunger and work stress.

The advanced gym workouts were honestly too difficult for my beginner fitness level - I had to scale back the weights significantly and couldn't complete all the sets.

My adherence was around 60% as expected; I hit about 4 out of 7 days on the meal plan perfectly, and made it to all 3 gym sessions though with modified intensity. The cooking was harder than anticipated with my beginner skills - the Chicken Kabsa and Lamb Kofta took longer to prepare than expected. I found myself eating simpler versions or grabbing quick alternatives on busier days. The calorie target felt high some days, so I naturally ate slightly less. Sleep remained challenging at around 6.5 hours due to work stress. I'm feeling some good muscle soreness, especially after leg day, and noticed slightly better energy mid-week.

The shakshuka breakfast was good and filling, but by mid-afternoon I was struggling with energy. The advanced gym workouts were way too intense for my beginner fitness level - I couldn't complete the full sets and had to modify most exercises. My form probably wasn't great either.

I managed to stick to the meal plan most days, though I'll admit I had an extra coffee with a pastry on Wednesday when I met a friend. The kabsa recipe was delicious and my family enjoyed it too. The workouts were quite intense for my fitness level - the 'Advanced' gym sessions really pushed me. I completed about 70% of each workout, modifying some exercises and taking longer rest periods. My legs were very sore after the first leg day! I'm sleeping well, around 7-8 hours most nights. I felt a bit tired mid-week but my energy improved by the weekend. The labneh meals were easy to prepare which helped on busy days. I'm proud that I showed up to the gym 4 times as planned, even though I couldn't complete everything perfectly."
P18,2025-W47,26.2,20.4,60.7,1980,7.4,"This week was a solid effort overall. I managed to stick to the meal plan most days, though I had a couple of slip-ups when I got home late from work and grabbed something quick instead of cooking. The workouts were challenging but doable - I really felt the leg days! My muscles were sore for about 48 hours after each lower body session, which I'm told is normal for beginners. I had to modify some exercises, especially the ones requiring more core strength. By Thursday I was feeling more energetic, and I noticed my sleep quality improved mid-week. The budget worked out well - I meal prepped on Sunday which saved both money and time during the week. I did have one day where I only got 6 hours of sleep due to work stress, but otherwise maintained my usual 7-8 hours. My cooking skills are still basic, so I kept meals simple - lots of grilled chicken, rice, and steamed vegetables. I'm feeling motivated to continue, though I know I need to work on my consistency, especially on weekends when my routine gets disrupted."
P18,2025-W48,26,20.5,60.3,1875,7.4,"Week 2 completed! This week felt noticeably different from Week 1. My body is starting to adapt to the workout routine, though I still feel challenged. Monday's W25 workout was tough - those lunges really got me, but the DOMS wasn't as severe as last week. Wednesday's W21 session felt more manageable; I'm getting better at the form on bodyweight exercises. Friday I almost skipped due to work fatigue, but pushed through and felt proud afterward - completed about 80% intensity. Saturday's workout was my strongest of the week.

Diet-wise, I'm getting more confident with meal prep. Monday through Thursday I stuck pretty well to the plan, hitting around 75% adherence. Made a big batch of grilled chicken and vegetables on Sunday that lasted through Wednesday. Thursday I underestimated portions and ended up about 300 calories short. Friday was challenging - had a work event with catered food that didn't match my plan, so I estimate only 50% adherence that day. Weekend was mixed: Saturday I did well until evening when family wanted takeout (about 60% adherence), and Sunday I got back on track with fresh meal prep for the upcoming week (80% adherence).

Still struggling a bit with cooking skills - burned some chicken on Tuesday and had to improvise with eggs. My budget of 40 SAR/day is working but requires careful planning. Bought in bulk this week which helped. Sleep averaged around 7.4 hours, though Wednesday night I only got 6.5 hours due to work stress.

Physically, I notice I'm less winded going up stairs at work. My clothes feel slightly less tight around the waist. Energy levels are improving mid-week. Still get fatigued by Friday but recovering better. No injuries, just normal muscle soreness that fades by day 2-3 post-workout."
P18,2025-W49,25.7,20.6,59.9,485,7.5,"Week 3 complete and I'm honestly surprised at my consistency! Started Monday strong with W25 (full body strength) - still challenging but my form is definitely improving. The 520 kcal daily target seemed impossibly low at first, but I realized this must be a SUPPLEMENT to my regular meals, not my total intake. That makes way more sense! 

Tuesday was rest day and I meal-prepped some lentil soup and grilled chicken - my cooking is getting better, though I still rely heavily on simple recipes. Wednesday's W21 (cardio intervals) had me breathing hard but I finished all rounds. My knees felt good, which is a win.

Thursday I had a work lunch that threw off my supplemental nutrition plan - ended up eating a larger restaurant meal and skipped my planned snack. Not perfect but I'm learning to adapt. Friday's W25 session felt tough after the disrupted eating, but I pushed through with slightly lighter weights.

Weekend was mixed - Saturday's W21 workout done, but a family gathering on Saturday evening meant I completely abandoned my diet tracking. Sunday I got back on track with meal prep for the coming week. 

Overall adherence maybe 70% this week - hit all 4 workouts (100%!), but diet was closer to 65% due to that family event. Sleep averaged around 7.5 hours which felt good. My body is definitely adapting - less soreness, more energy during workouts. The scale shows a small drop which is encouraging. My clothes fit slightly better around the waist.

Barriers this week: social eating situations remain tough, and I'm still intimidated by complex recipes. Budget-wise, I'm managing well by buying frozen vegetables and bulk proteins. The 40 SAR daily budget is working when I plan ahead.

Looking forward to Week 4 - I want to push a bit harder in the strength sessions and maybe try one new recipe!"
P18,2025-W50,25.5,20.7,59.7,2245,7.3,"Week 4 complete and I'm honestly quite proud of myself! Started Monday strong with W25 workout - the full-body routine felt challenging but manageable. My form is definitely improving, especially on squats. Tuesday I stuck to my meal prep pretty well, though I added extra olive oil to my salad which probably pushed me over budget slightly. Wednesday's W21 cardio session was tough - 30 minutes felt long but I pushed through. Thursday was my struggle day - work lunch meeting meant I had to improvise with restaurant food, estimated around 2400 kcal that day. Friday's W25 felt great, noticed I could hold plank longer than last week! Saturday family gathering was predictable - I tried to be mindful but definitely went over target, maybe 2600 kcal with all the rice dishes and desserts. Sunday's W21 cardio felt easier than Wednesday, which shows progress! Overall diet adherence around 70% this week - better than last week's 65%. Completed all 4 scheduled workouts which I'm really happy about. Energy levels have been good with my 7.5 hours of sleep most nights, though Saturday I only got 6.5 hours. The beginner progression is working well for me. I can feel myself getting stronger and my clothes fit a tiny bit better. Still struggling with social eating situations but I'm learning to plan better. Budget stayed under 40 SAR daily except Thursday (restaurant lunch was about 55 SAR). Weight seems stable with very minor changes - not expecting dramatic shifts but the consistency feels sustainable."
P18,2025-W51,25.3,20.8,59.5,2145,7.2,"Week 51 is complete! This week felt like a continuation of the momentum I built in Week 50. I managed to stick to my 4 workout schedule again, which I'm really proud of. Monday and Wednesday were W25 (full body strength), and Tuesday and Thursday were W21 (cardio/core). My form on squats continues to improve - I really focused on keeping my knees aligned and going deeper. The plank holds are getting easier too; I held for 45 seconds on Thursday without shaking as much.

Diet-wise, I'd say I hit about 70-75% adherence this week. Monday through Wednesday were solid - I meal prepped on Sunday evening and that really helped. I had my usual challenges mid-week. On Thursday, there was a holiday potluck at work and I definitely went over budget both financially (about 50 SAR for the day) and calorically (estimated around 2500 kcal). I tried to make better choices than usual though - more protein, smaller portions of the heavier dishes.

Friday was good, back on track. Saturday was trickier - we had extended family visiting for a pre-holiday gathering. I estimated around 2400 kcal that day, but I was more mindful about portions and skipped the second dessert. Sunday I got back to my meal prep routine.

Sleep averaged around 7.2 hours this week. I had one shorter night on Wednesday (about 6.5 hours) because I stayed up wrapping gifts, but otherwise maintained my 7-7.5 hour range. Energy levels were good throughout the week, even with the holiday busyness.

Budget management was successful 5 out of 7 days, staying at or under 40 SAR. The two over-budget days were the social events, which I'm learning to anticipate better.

Physically, I'm noticing my clothes fitting slightly better, especially around my waist. My recovery time between workouts continues to improve - I'm not as sore on rest days. The scale hasn't moved dramatically, but I feel stronger and more energized. The beginner progression is working well for me.

Looking ahead, I know the actual holiday week will be challenging, but I feel more equipped with strategies now. I'm planning to maintain my workout schedule as much as possible and focus on portion control during celebrations rather than restriction."
P18,2025-W52,25.1,20.9,59.3,2215,7.1,"This week was a real test with New Year's Eve falling right in the middle! I managed to complete all 4 scheduled workouts (Monday W25, Tuesday W21, Thursday W25, Saturday W21) which I'm really proud of. The holiday timing made diet adherence harder than last week - I'd estimate around 65% adherence overall. New Year's Eve was the big challenge with a family celebration where I consumed about 2600 kcal, but I planned for it and kept the surrounding days cleaner. My meal prep on Sunday helped me stay on track Monday through Wednesday. Energy levels were good on workout days, though I felt a bit sluggish Wednesday after a shorter sleep night (6.8 hours). My plank hold is now consistently at 50 seconds, which feels amazing! I can definitely feel my core getting stronger. The squats are feeling more natural, and I'm noticing better balance. Budget stayed within limits 6 out of 7 days - only the New Year's celebration pushed me over at about 55 SAR. Recovery continues to improve, with less muscle soreness lasting into second days. I'm starting to see subtle changes in how my clothes fit around my waist. The holiday period is wrapping up which should make next week easier to stay consistent."
P18,2026-W01,24.9,21,59.1,2050,7.2,"Week 1 of 2026 went reasonably well! I managed to complete all 4 scheduled workouts (W25/W21/W25/W21) as planned on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday. My energy levels were good, especially after getting back into a normal routine post-holidays. The W25 workouts felt challenging but manageable - I'm noticing my squat depth is improving and my balance feels more stable. The W21 sessions were great for active recovery between the harder days.

Diet adherence was around 68% this week, which I'm happy with given I'm still adjusting after the New Year celebrations. I hit my calorie target pretty closely most days, averaging about 2050 kcal daily. Tuesday and Saturday were my weaker days - Tuesday I went to a colleague's lunch gathering (about 2400 kcal, 48 SAR) and Saturday I had some traditional Saudi sweets that pushed me over (2350 kcal, 43 SAR). The other 5 days I stayed within budget and close to my targets.

Meal prep on Sunday helped tremendously - I prepared grilled chicken, brown rice, and roasted vegetables for 4 days. Breakfasts were consistent: labneh with whole wheat bread, cucumber, and dates. This kept me on track and within my 40 SAR daily budget for 5 out of 7 days.

Sleep averaged 7.2 hours this week, which is slightly better than last week. I had one night (Thursday) where I only got 6.5 hours due to some work stress, but I compensated with 7.8 hours on Friday night. My body is responding well to the consistent sleep schedule.

Plank holds are now consistently at 50-52 seconds, and I'm feeling stronger in my core. I attempted 55 seconds on Friday but couldn't maintain form, so I'm staying at 50 for now. Recovery between workouts feels good - minimal soreness, just healthy muscle fatigue.

I'm noticing subtle changes in how my clothes fit, particularly around my waist and thighs. The scale isn't showing dramatic changes, but I can feel I'm getting stronger and my endurance is improving. I can now do the full W25 workout with fewer breaks than when I started.

Looking forward to Week 2! My goal is to improve diet adherence to 75% and maybe try extending my plank to 55 seconds by the end of next week."
P18,2026-W02,24.6,21.1,58.9,1465,7.1,"Week 2 complete! This week felt more challenging than last week, honestly. The diet target at 535 kcal seems really low - I'm assuming this is meant to be a deficit meal or supplement to my regular eating? I interpreted it as a specific meal plan component and tried to incorporate it alongside my regular meals, keeping my total daily intake around 1400-1500 kcal which feels more sustainable.

Monday started strong with W25 (the cardio and bodyweight circuit). I'm getting better at the movements, though the burpees still kick my butt! Managed 3 sets with decent form. Tuesday I did W21 (strength focus) and really focused on my squat depth - I can feel my glutes engaging more now which is exciting progress.

Wednesday was tough - had a work dinner that ran late and I was exhausted. Skipped the planned workout and my meal choices weren't great. Felt guilty but reminded myself that life happens. Thursday I got back on track with W25 again, and honestly felt stronger than Monday. My plank hold hit 54 seconds which is a new personal best!

Friday's W21 session went well. The dumbbell exercises (I'm using 3kg weights) are feeling less awkward. My form is improving and I'm not as shaky. Weekend was a mixed bag - Saturday I had a family gathering and definitely went over budget on food, but I made conscious choices to load up on protein and veggies when possible. Sunday I meal prepped for the coming week which always helps me feel in control.

Sleep averaged about 7.1 hours this week - slightly down from my usual 7.2, probably due to the Wednesday late night. Energy levels were good on workout days, a bit sluggish on rest days. I'm noticing my clothes fitting slightly differently around the waist, which is motivating even though the scale isn't moving dramatically.

Adherence-wise, I'd say I hit about 65% this week - 4/4 workouts completed (100%), but only 4.5/7 days on diet budget due to Wednesday dinner and Saturday's gathering. That Wednesday really threw me off mentally, but I recovered well. The low calorie target continues to puzzle me - I'm treating it as a guideline for one meal rather than total daily intake to avoid feeling depleted during workouts."
P18,2026-W03,24.5,21.1,59.1,1520,6.8,"Week 3 felt like a real test of my commitment, but I'm proud of how I navigated it. Started strong Monday and Tuesday with solid workouts (W25 both days) and good meal prep discipline. Wednesday was my planned rest day, and I stuck to my diet pretty well despite being tempted by office snacks. Thursday's W21 workout felt challenging - my legs were still recovering from the squats earlier in the week, but I pushed through with modified form.

Friday is where things got tricky. I had a minor cold coming on (scratchy throat, slight fatigue) which made me question whether to work out. I decided to do my scheduled W25 but scaled back intensity by about 20% - better to move than skip entirely, right? My energy was lower, so I didn't hit my usual plank time (only 48 seconds vs my 54-second PR). Diet adherence slipped to about 50% that day because I was craving comfort foods and ended up having some extra rice with dinner.

The weekend was a mixed bag. Saturday I completely skipped my W21 workout because the cold symptoms peaked - I spent most of the day resting and honestly felt guilty about it, but my body needed recovery. I did some gentle stretching instead. Diet was okay, maybe 60% adherence - I stayed within budget but had more carbs than planned. Sunday I felt much better and did my makeup W21 workout with good energy! The active recovery helped me feel human again.

Meal prep on Sunday was crucial - I made my chicken and veggie bowls for the week ahead, though I simplified recipes since my energy wasn't 100%. Budget-wise, I stayed right around 40 SAR/day average (280 SAR for the week), even with buying some extra ginger and honey for my cold.

Sleep was impacted - averaged 6.8 hours instead of my usual 7.1, mainly due to congestion Thursday and Friday nights. I know this affected my recovery and probably my adherence too. Body-wise, I feel like I'm maintaining rather than progressing this week, which makes sense given the illness. My clothes still fit better than three weeks ago, so I'm holding onto that win. The scale showed a tiny uptick, probably water retention from being sick.

Key learning: listening to my body and modifying rather than quitting completely felt like the right approach. I completed 3.5 out of 4 planned workouts (counting Friday's scaled session as 0.5), and diet adherence was about 60% for the week. Not perfect, but sustainable given the circumstances."
P18,2026-W04,24.2,21.3,58.9,1950,6.9,"Week 4 felt like a turning point - I'm finally recovering from that cold and getting back into rhythm. Monday started strong with W25, and I actually felt energized rather than dragging myself through it. The 40 SAR budget continues to work well, though I'm getting a bit tired of the same meal prep rotation. Tuesday's rest day was needed, and I used it to prep some variety into my meals - found a sale on chicken breast which helped stretch the budget. Wednesday's W21 workout was challenging but manageable, though my plank time is still recovering (only hit 52 seconds). Thursday I completed W25 again and noticed I'm getting stronger on the bodyweight squats - form is improving. Friday was tough - work ran late and I was tempted to skip, but I pushed through W21 with slightly lower intensity. Weekend was interesting - I actually meal prepped on Saturday morning instead of Sunday, which gave me more flexibility. Sleep averaged 6.9 hours this week, up slightly from last week's congestion-disrupted nights. I'm learning that consistency matters more than perfection. My energy levels are noticeably better, and I'm not getting as winded climbing the stairs at work. The 70% adherence propensity feels accurate - I'm hitting most targets but still have those days where life gets in the way. Diet adherence was about 75% this week (5.25/7 days) - better than last week's 60%. I did have one evening where I grabbed takeout after a particularly draining day, but I made reasonable choices. Body feels stronger even if the scale hasn't moved dramatically. I'm starting to see this as a sustainable lifestyle rather than a temporary challenge."
P18,2026-W05,23.9,21.5,58.5,2085,6.9,"Week 5 Complete - Building Momentum!

This week felt like a true turning point. Coming off Week 4's perfect workout adherence, I maintained strong consistency with 3/4 planned workouts completed (W25, W21, W25). Friday's W21 was skipped due to a family emergency that required evening attention, but I didn't spiral - just acknowledged it and moved on.

Diet adherence landed around 70% (4.9/7 days), which is slightly down from last week but still solid given the circumstances. My meal prep Saturday morning routine is officially locked in - prepped chicken thighs (found another sale!), brown rice, and roasted vegetables. This gave me easy lunches Monday-Thursday. Wednesday I had an unplanned shawarma wrap (35 SAR) when meal prep ran out earlier than expected, and Sunday I grabbed a quick restaurant meal with a friend (48 SAR - went slightly over budget but worth it for social connection).

Sleep averaged 6.9 hours again - consistent but I'm noticing I feel better on the nights I get closer to 7.5 hours. Tuesday and Saturday were my best sleep nights (7.2 hours each), and I woke up feeling genuinely energized. Thursday was rough with only 6.3 hours due to work stress keeping my mind racing.

Workout highlights: Plank hold hit 55 seconds on Monday's W25 session! I'm genuinely proud of this progress. Squats are feeling more natural - I can feel my glutes engaging properly now, which wasn't happening in Week 1-2. The W21 cardio intervals on Wednesday left me sweaty but accomplished. My recovery between sets is improving; I don't feel as winded.

Body changes: The scale moved down slightly (0.4kg), but more importantly, my work pants are noticeably looser in the waist. I'm starting to see a bit more definition in my shoulders when I look in the mirror. Energy levels remain high - no afternoon crashes like I used to experience.

Challenges: Friday's missed workout bothered me initially, but I'm learning that 3/4 is still 75% adherence and life happens. Hydration slipped a bit mid-week (only 1.5L on Wednesday and Thursday) but I course-corrected. Budget management required creativity - I'm getting better at finding sales and using cheaper protein sources like eggs and lentils.

Wins: No injury or excessive soreness. Completed my first full week of consistent 6.9hr sleep. Meal prep timing is dialed in. Mental resilience is growing - I'm not letting one missed workout derail my mindset. Starting to crave movement on rest days, which is wild.

Looking ahead: Week 6 goal is to maintain 3-4 workouts, push plank to 60 seconds, and maybe experiment with adding a short morning walk on rest days. Budget is tight but manageable. I'm feeling genuinely capable and less like a beginner every day."
P18,2026-W06,23.6,21.7,58.3,2045,6.7,"Week 6 felt like a consolidation week - I hit all four workouts for the first time in weeks, which felt incredible! Monday's W25 was tough coming off the weekend, but I pushed through and matched my Saturday performance. The W21 on Wednesday was smoother than previous weeks; I'm finally feeling comfortable with the exercise flow and my form is clicking. Thursday's W25 showed real progress - I held my plank for 58 seconds (new PR!) and my squats felt powerful. Saturday's W21 was my strongest yet; I added an extra rep to my push-ups on the last set without even planning it.

Diet adherence was solid at about 75% this week. I meal-prepped Sunday evening which set me up beautifully for Mon-Wed. Thursday I grabbed a quick shawarma plate (42 SAR) after work because I hadn't prepped enough protein, which put me slightly over budget. Friday's rest day I kept things simple with eggs and lentils. Weekend meals were on track except for Saturday post-workout when I was ravenous and added an extra snack (dates and almonds, about 8 SAR extra).

Sleep was my struggle this week - averaged 6.7 hours, down from my 6.9 baseline. Work deadlines Tuesday and Wednesday kept me up late, and I felt it in my energy Thursday morning. I compensated with an earlier bedtime Friday and Saturday (7.1 hours each) which helped tremendously. I'm noticing that sub-6.5 hour nights directly impact my workout motivation and my tendency to grab convenient (pricier) food.

Physically, I'm seeing changes I can't ignore. My work blazer fits differently across the shoulders - there's actual shape there now. The quad soreness from last week is completely gone, replaced by this feeling of readiness. My resting heart rate has dropped noticeably (I can tell when I'm sitting at my desk). Recovery between sets is faster; I'm not gasping for air like I was in Week 3.

Budget came in at 41.2 SAR/day average - the Thursday overage and Saturday snack added up, but I'm learning to balance social eating and convenience with planning. I've realized that spending 5 SAR extra on pre-cooked rotisserie chicken saves me 30 minutes and prevents the 40 SAR restaurant fallback.

Mentally, completing all four workouts has given me such a confidence boost. I'm starting to identify as someone who exercises regularly, not someone who's 'trying to exercise.' That shift feels huge. On rest days, I genuinely wanted to move - took two 20-minute walks on Tuesday and Friday just because. No guilt about the Thursday meal slip; I course-corrected immediately.

Challenges: Sleep management remains my biggest barrier. When work stress hits, I sacrifice sleep first, which cascades into everything else. I need to protect that 7-hour minimum more fiercely. Also, mid-week meal prep fatigue is real - by Wednesday evening I'm tired of cooking, which is when I'm most vulnerable to convenience purchases.

Wins: Four workouts! Plank PR! Visible shoulder definition! Didn't miss a workout due to motivation - only scheduled rest days. Hydration stayed consistent at 2L+ every day except Thursday (1.8L). My squat depth is finally hitting parallel consistently.

Looking ahead: I want to maintain this four-workout rhythm and focus on sleep quality. Maybe I'll try prepping just one extra dinner mid-week to prevent Thursday's pattern. My body is responding beautifully to this routine - I feel stronger, more energized, and genuinely excited about Week 7."
P18,2026-W07,23.3,21.9,58.1,2145,6.8,"Week 7 felt like a consolidation week - building on Week 6's momentum but facing real-world friction points. Completed all 4 scheduled workouts (Mon W25, Wed W21, Thu W25, Sat W21) which maintains my perfect streak, but diet adherence slipped to about 65% (4.5/7 days solid). The culprit? A combination of social obligations and meal prep fatigue hitting harder than expected.

Monday's W25 workout was strong - I'm noticing that my body now anticipates the Monday session positively rather than with dread. Plank held for 62 seconds, a new PR by 4 seconds. Energy was good despite starting the week at 6.5 hours sleep. Tuesday was a rest day but I felt restless, so took a 25-minute evening walk around the neighborhood. This voluntary movement thing is becoming habitual.

Wednesday brought the predicted meal prep vulnerability. After work I was mentally exhausted and ended up ordering chicken mandi (48 SAR - budget overage). The meal was delicious but sodium-heavy, and I could feel the bloat Thursday morning. Wednesday's W21 workout still happened though - I've learned that motivation follows action, not the other way around. Push-ups felt harder than usual, likely the heavy dinner.

Thursday's W25 session was my weakest of the week. Sleep was only 6.3 hours due to a work call that ran late Wednesday night, and I could feel the deficit in my squat depth and overall energy. Still completed everything but had to take longer rests between sets. The rotisserie chicken strategy saved me again for dinner (15 SAR for half chicken, paired with pre-cut vegetables).

Friday rest day I prioritized sleep recovery - got 7.4 hours which felt restorative. Saturday morning I felt recharged and the W21 workout reflected it. Added an extra set of bodyweight squats just because I had the energy. This is the intrinsic motivation shift I noted last week becoming more pronounced.

The weekend presented a social challenge: a family gathering on Sunday with traditional foods. I made conscious choices (smaller portions of rice, more protein and vegetables) but still exceeded my calorie target by about 400 kcal. However, I'm learning that one day doesn't derail progress, and I didn't experience the guilt spiral that would have happened months ago.

Sleep averaged 6.8 hours for the week - a slight improvement from last week's 6.7, but still below my optimal 7+ hours. The Thursday deficit was the main drag. I'm noticing that sub-6.5 hour nights directly impact workout quality and food decision-making.

Budget averaged 42.8 SAR/day, pushed up by Wednesday's mandi and Sunday's family contribution (20 SAR). The rotisserie chicken strategy continues to be a winner - it's now a Thursday staple.

Body-wise, I'm seeing continued subtle changes. The blazer fit improvement is holding, and I noticed in the mirror that my upper back has more definition. Weight is stable which I interpret as recomposition continuing. Squat form is now automatic - I don't have to think about hitting parallel anymore. Recovery between sets continues to improve; my heart rate drops faster now.

The mental shift is the most significant change. I had a moment Saturday where I realized I was looking forward to Monday's workout. That's not 'trying to be consistent' - that's identity change. I'm an exerciser now, not someone who exercises sometimes.

Challenges: Meal prep fatigue is real and predictable (Wednesday evenings). Sleep optimization remains my primary limiter - I need strategies for the work-deadline weeks. The social food navigation is improving but requires ongoing attention.

Wins: Perfect workout attendance for second consecutive week (8/8 over two weeks). Voluntary movement on rest days is now habitual. Plank PR. Identity shift solidifying. Recovery metrics improving. No injuries or significant soreness.

Next week focus: Protect sleep more aggressively, especially mid-week. Pre-prep Wednesday evening meal on Tuesday to bypass decision fatigue. Continue the workout momentum - it's working."
P18,2026-W08,23,22.1,57.9,1720,6.7,"Week 8 was a solid continuation of my momentum, though I hit some real-world turbulence that tested my new identity as 'someone who exercises.' I completed 3 out of 4 planned workouts (75% adherence), which feels honest given what happened mid-week. Monday's W25 was fantastic - I felt strong, my plank hit 65 seconds (new PR!), and I was genuinely excited to start the week. Wednesday's W21 happened but was compromised by a work crisis that kept me up until 11:30pm Tuesday night (only 5.9 hours sleep). I pushed through but my form suffered on squats and I felt foggy. Thursday I made the mature decision to skip W25 entirely - I was running on fumes and recognized that forcing it would risk injury or burnout. That's growth, right? Saturday's W21 was redemptive: full energy, perfect form, even added an extra set of squats like last week.

Diet adherence hovered around 60% (4/7 days solid). The Wednesday meal prep vulnerability struck again - exhausted from poor sleep and the workout, I ordered shawarma wraps for 44 SAR instead of cooking. Sunday I attended a niece's birthday party and made conscious choices (small cake slice, focused on protein), but still went over by about 300 kcal. The wins: Monday/Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday I nailed my rotisserie chicken + veggie strategy, and I'm getting faster at meal prep (Thursday took only 22 minutes). My rest-day walks continued - Tuesday 30 minutes, Friday evening 20 minutes while on a phone call.

Sleep averaged 6.7 hours (down slightly from 6.8 last week), with that brutal Tuesday night dragging the average down. Range was 5.9-7.3 hours. I'm noticing the direct correlation between sleep and everything else - workout quality, food decisions, mood. Budget averaged 41.2 SAR/day, well within limits despite the Wednesday splurge (balanced by Sunday's 18 SAR contribution day). Body-wise, I'm seeing continued upper back definition, and my jeans are fitting differently around the thighs (muscle?) while the waist stays comfortable. Recovery heart rate continues improving. The Thursday rest decision felt like a win for long-term thinking over short-term perfectionism. Energy levels were good except Wed/Thu. No injuries. Hydration stayed around 2L+ except Wednesday (1.5L). Best workout: Saturday's strong W21. Weakest: Wednesday's sleep-deprived W21. Overall: imperfect week, but I'm learning to navigate real life without derailing completely."
P18,2026-W09,22.7,22.3,57.6,1940,6.5,"Week 9 felt like a consolidation week - not perfect, but I'm learning to accept that consistency beats perfection. Monday's W25 workout was solid, hit a new plank PR of 68 seconds which felt amazing. Tuesday I woke up exhausted (6.1 hours sleep) and made the mature decision to skip the planned W21 - my body needed recovery more than another workout. Wednesday I rallied with another W25 session, though my energy was only about 75%. The shawarma temptation hit again Thursday after a rough work call, but I prepped rotisserie chicken instead and felt proud of that choice. Friday's W21 was my best workout of the week - 7.2 hours sleep made such a difference. I can really see the correlation now between sleep and performance. Saturday I did my fourth workout (W21 again) even though I was tired, which felt like a win. Sunday was full rest and meal prep for the week ahead. My thighs are definitely getting stronger - I can feel it in daily movements like climbing stairs. The 6.5 hour average sleep is still my biggest barrier, but I'm working on it. Budget stayed under control at 39 SAR/day average. I'm starting to feel like an athlete, even on imperfect weeks."

The Mandi dinner was delicious but occasionally I reduced the lamb portion to 100g because it felt too heavy. I found myself quite sore after the upper body and leg sessions, especially in my thighs and shoulders. My energy levels improved mid-week once I adjusted to the routine. Sleep remained around my usual 6.5 hours - I tried to get more rest but work stress made it difficult. I did notice feeling stronger by day 5 and my clothes fit slightly better.

P19,2025-W46,16.4,30.35,78.1,2650,7.5,"Overall a solid week. The kabsa and ful medames were excellent - really enjoyed having traditional Saudi meals that fit my macros.

I managed to hit about 75% adherence - missed a couple of the labneh evening meals and substituted with lighter options when I got home late from work. The advanced workouts were challenging but doable at my intermediate level, though I had to scale back slightly on the leg day (7 exercises was ambitious). Energy levels were good throughout the week, especially on workout days. The fiber from ful and dates kept me satisfied. Sleep averaged around 7.5 hours which helped with recovery. Weight stayed relatively stable with a small increase, likely some muscle gain and water retention from the carb intake. The dates and laban snack became my pre-workout favorite."
P19,2025-W47,16.1,30.4,77.8,2580,7.4,"Week 47 was a solid endurance-focused week, though I definitely felt the cumulative fatigue by mid-week. Started strong with the cardio intervals on Monday (W03), which got my heart rate up nicely. The HIIT session (W07) on Tuesday was brutal but effective - I could feel my cardiovascular system adapting. Wednesday's circuit training (W11) was where I started noticing some leg heaviness, probably from the back-to-back intensity. Thursday's tempo run (W15) felt surprisingly good after a rest day consideration, but I kept the pace moderate. Friday's long steady-state session (W21) was mentally challenging but I pushed through about 85% of the prescribed duration before fatigue won.

Diet adherence was around 80% this week. The meal prep strategy continued to work well - having those containers ready made weekday nutrition much easier. I particularly enjoyed the zaatar and olive oil combinations on the roasted vegetables. Stayed within my 50 SAR daily budget by shopping smart at the local market. Had one evening where work stress led me to order takeout shawarma (probably added 400 extra calories that day), but I adjusted the next day. Hydration was excellent throughout - kept my 2L bottle with me constantly.

Sleep averaged about 7.5 hours, though Wednesday night was rough (maybe 6.5 hours) due to work deadline stress. Recovery felt adequate most days, though I could tell my body was working hard to adapt to the endurance volume. No injuries or significant soreness, just general fatigue in the legs by week's end. The high fiber intake continues to agree with me - no digestive issues whatsoever.

At my age (45-60 band), I'm learning to listen to my body more. When Friday's workout felt like it was pushing too hard, I backed off slightly rather than risk overtraining. Overall, I'm pleased with the consistency - 5/5 workouts completed, even if some were at slightly reduced intensity. The endurance goal is progressing well, and I can feel my aerobic capacity improving week by week."
P19,2025-W48,15.8,30.5,77.5,2680,7.3,"Week 48 complete! This was a solid week overall, though I definitely felt the accumulated fatigue from consistent training. Started strong on Monday and Tuesday with W03 and W07 workouts - the steady-state runs felt controlled and my heart rate recovery is noticeably better than a month ago. Wednesday's W11 tempo session was tough; I had to dial back the intensity slightly in the final intervals as my legs were heavy. Work stress hit mid-week which led to one completely off-plan dinner (shawarma and fries on Thursday evening - probably added 400 extra calories), but I didn't let it derail the entire week. 

Friday's W15 workout was surprisingly good despite the diet slip - maybe the extra carbs helped! Saturday's long W21 endurance run was the highlight - completed the full distance at target pace and felt strong throughout. My breathing efficiency continues to improve. Sunday was active recovery with light stretching and a short walk.

Diet adherence was about 75% this week - meal prep on Sunday helped tremendously for Mon-Wed, but Thursday's stress meal and a few portion size miscalculations on snacks added up. I stayed within budget at 48 SAR/day by shopping the midweek sales at the local market. Sleep was disrupted Tuesday and Wednesday nights (only got about 6.5 hours each) due to work deadlines, but I prioritized recovery Thursday-Saturday and averaged back up to 7.5 hours those nights.

Physically, I'm feeling leaner and my endurance capacity is definitely expanding. The 5-day workout schedule is sustainable but requires careful attention to recovery nutrition and sleep. Next week I'll focus on tighter portion control and maybe prep some emergency healthy snacks to avoid stress-eating situations."
P19,2025-W49,15.6,30.7,77.6,2615,7.4,"Week 49 completed with solid consistency overall. Started strong Monday with W03 workout - felt the cardiovascular improvements from previous weeks kicking in during the interval work. Diet adherence was good at around 78% this week, which is slightly above my usual 75%. Tuesday's sleep took a hit (6.8 hours) due to work stress, and I could feel the fatigue during Wednesday's W07 session, though I pushed through. The budget constraint of 50 SAR/day continues to be manageable - I'm getting better at meal prepping on weekends which helps both financially (averaged 47.5 SAR/day) and nutritionally. Thursday's W11 workout was excellent, energy fully restored after catching up on sleep Wednesday night (7.8 hours). Had one unplanned meal Friday evening - a work dinner that pushed me off the macro targets, probably added an extra 400 calories and too much sodium. Saturday's W15 was challenging but completed all sets. Sunday's W21 endurance session felt great - this is where I really notice the progress, maintaining higher intensity for longer periods. Recovery protocols are working well - foam rolling and proper cool-downs making a real difference. Mid-week fatigue pattern continues to be my main challenge, but the weekend recovery strategy compensates. Overall feeling strong and motivated heading into next week."
P19,2025-W50,15.4,30.9,77.5,2615,7.2,"Week 50 was a strong continuation of my endurance training block. I managed to complete all 5 planned workouts (W03, W07, W11, W15, W21) with good quality across the board. The W21 Sunday session felt particularly strong - I'm definitely seeing the cumulative benefits of consistent training over the past several weeks.

Diet adherence was solid at approximately 76% this week. I hit my macros most days, though I had a couple of minor deviations. Wednesday I was about 150 kcal under target due to a busy work schedule and skipping my afternoon snack - I felt the energy dip during my evening workout (W11). Saturday evening I attended a family gathering and went about 200 kcal over, but it was mostly healthy food choices, just larger portions. My daily average came in around 2615 kcal, very close to my 2628 target.

Sleep was decent but slightly below my recent average at 7.2 hours per night. I had two rough nights - Monday (6.9 hours due to work stress keeping me up) and Thursday (6.7 hours, woke up early and couldn't get back to sleep). The other nights ranged from 7.2 to 7.6 hours. I definitely noticed the impact on recovery, particularly on Tuesday and Friday when I felt a bit more fatigued.

Budget management remained excellent at 48.2 SAR/day average. I'm getting very efficient at meal planning and prep. I batch-cooked chicken breast, brown rice, and roasted vegetables on Sunday which saved both time and money throughout the week. I splurged slightly on some fresh salmon for Friday dinner (22 SAR), but balanced it with simpler meals earlier in the week.

Cardiovascular improvements continue to be noticeable. My heart rate recovery is faster, and I'm maintaining higher intensities with less perceived exertion. The W21 workout on Sunday was a perfect example - I pushed harder than previous weeks but felt more controlled throughout. My intermediate fitness level is definitely trending toward the upper end of that category.

Recovery protocols are working well. I've been consistent with foam rolling after each workout (10-15 minutes) and doing dynamic stretching before sessions. Nutrition timing around workouts has been on point - I'm getting my pre-workout carbs in 90 minutes before training and post-workout protein within 30 minutes.

Weight is holding steady with positive body composition changes continuing. I can see more definition in my legs and core, and my clothes fit slightly looser around the waist. The scale shows minimal change but I know I'm exchanging fat for muscle, which is exactly what I want while building endurance.

No injuries or concerning issues this week. I had some mild DOMS in my quads after the W15 workout on Thursday, but nothing that impacted subsequent sessions. My knees and ankles feel stable and strong.

Looking ahead to Week 51, I'm feeling confident and motivated. The consistency is paying off and I'm excited to see where my endurance capacity will be by year-end. I need to prioritize sleep a bit more - I'll aim for lights out by 10:15 PM to ensure I'm getting closer to 7.5 hours consistently."
P19,2025-W51,15.1,31,77.1,2548,7,"Week 51 completed with solid consistency despite holiday season distractions. Started strong Monday and Tuesday with perfect adherence to both diet and workouts. Wednesday hit a rough patch - only got 6.5 hours sleep due to work stress, which affected my W11 HIIT session. I managed to complete it but felt sluggish throughout. Thursday recovery was better, and I nailed the tempo run Friday morning feeling energized. Weekend was challenging with family gatherings - Saturday I went over budget by about 180 kcal (extra dates and Arabic coffee at a gathering), but Sunday's long run felt fantastic. My cardiovascular endurance is noticeably improved; the 90-minute endurance session felt easier than previous weeks, maintaining better pace with lower perceived effort. Recovery between intervals is faster now. Sleep averaged 7.0 hours this week - two nights dipped to 6.5 and 6.8 hours due to holiday planning, but I compensated with better rest Thursday and Saturday. Budget held at 49.1 SAR/day, slightly under target. Meal prep Sunday helped enormously - having pre-portioned chicken, rice, and roasted vegetables saved time and kept me on track. The intermediate cooking skills paid off with efficient batch cooking. Energy levels were good except Wednesday post-poor-sleep. No injuries or soreness beyond normal DOMS. Body feels leaner, especially around midsection. Noticed improved definition in legs from consistent training. Minor deviations: skipped afternoon snack Tuesday (busy schedule), added extra protein shake Thursday to hit macros. Overall adherence approximately 78% - above my typical 75% propensity. The endurance focus is clearly working; resting heart rate dropped 2 bpm over the week. Ready to maintain momentum through the holiday week ahead, though anticipating some challenges with family commitments."
P19,2025-W52,14.8,31.1,76.7,2748,6.8,"Week 52 was a solid continuation of my endurance-focused program, though the holiday season presented some unique challenges. I managed to complete 4 out of 5 planned workouts, which I'm reasonably satisfied with given family commitments on Christmas Day. My adherence propensity of 75% played out realistically - I stuck to the plan most days but allowed myself some flexibility during the festivities.

The workout progression felt appropriate for my intermediate fitness level. The interval runs (W03, W07) were challenging but manageable, and I noticed my recovery times between sets improving compared to previous weeks. The tempo run (W11) on day 3 was particularly satisfying - I held a steady pace for 40 minutes and felt strong throughout. The long run (W15) on Saturday was tough mentally but I pushed through, covering about 15km. I had to skip the recovery run (W21) on Christmas Day, which was a conscious decision to prioritize family time.

Diet-wise, I achieved approximately 72% adherence this week. The 2665 kcal target with high carbs (300g) supported my endurance training well. I meal-prepped on Sunday and Wednesday, which helped tremendously. My intermediate cooking skills allowed me to create satisfying, macro-balanced meals. However, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day saw me exceed my calorie targets by about 400-500 kcal each day due to traditional Saudi dishes and sweets. I didn't stress about it - the occasional indulgence is part of sustainable living. My budget of 50 SAR/day was sufficient, though I spent about 52 SAR on Christmas Day with special ingredients.

Sleep averaged 6.8 hours this week, slightly below my usual 7 hours. Three nights were suboptimal (6-6.5 hours) due to late family gatherings and some pre-holiday stress. I noticed the impact on my Thursday workout - my legs felt heavier and my pace was slower. The other nights I managed 7-7.5 hours, which felt restorative.

Physically, I'm seeing continued improvements in body composition. My cardiovascular system feels stronger - my resting heart rate has dropped a few beats and I recover faster between intervals. The visible changes in muscle definition, particularly in my legs and core, are motivating. At 45-60 years old, these adaptations take time, but consistency is paying off.

No injuries to report, though I did experience some mild calf tightness mid-week. I addressed it with extra stretching and foam rolling, and it resolved within two days. My knees, which I monitor carefully at my age, felt stable throughout.

Looking ahead, I'm pleased with the trajectory. The slight weight loss combined with maintained muscle mass suggests I'm in a good place metabolically. My endurance goal is progressing well - I can sustain higher intensities for longer periods. The holiday disruption was minor and expected. I'm ready to return to full adherence next week."
P19,2026-W01,14.5,31.3,76.3,2715,7.1,"Week 1 of 2026 started strong with renewed motivation after the holiday period. I managed to complete all 5 scheduled workouts (W03, W07, W11, W15, W21), which felt like a solid return to form. The endurance-focused sessions were challenging but rewarding - particularly the longer tempo runs where I could feel my cardiovascular improvements from previous weeks carrying over.

Diet adherence landed at about 78%, which is actually above my typical 75% propensity. I attribute this to post-holiday discipline and meal prepping on Sunday. The 2679 kcal target felt appropriate for my training load, though I went slightly over on Wednesday (around 2850 kcal) after a particularly intense interval session left me ravenous. Budget management was excellent - averaged 48.7 SAR/day by focusing on bulk rice, chicken, eggs, and seasonal vegetables from the local market.

Sleep improved to an average of 7.1 hours, which made a noticeable difference in recovery. I prioritized getting to bed by 22:30 most nights, though Friday was rough (only 6.2 hours) due to work deadline stress. The extra rest definitely helped with workout performance and reduced the afternoon fatigue I'd been experiencing.

Physically, I'm noticing continued body recomposition. Clothes fit better around the waist, and there's more definition in my shoulders and legs. No injuries or significant soreness, just the normal post-workout muscle fatigue. I did experience some mild quad tightness after the hill repeats on Thursday, but foam rolling and proper warm-ups kept it manageable.

One challenge this week was balancing work demands with training. Two early morning meetings meant I had to shift workouts to evening, which isn't ideal for my energy levels but necessary. I'm learning to be more flexible with timing while maintaining consistency.

Looking ahead, I want to maintain this momentum. The endurance gains are tangible - my easy pace feels more comfortable, and recovery between intervals is faster. I'm considering adding a sixth workout day in a few weeks if recovery continues to go well, but for now, 5 days feels sustainable and effective."
P19,2026-W02,14.2,31.5,76.1,2598,7.2,"This week was a solid continuation of my 2026 momentum. I managed to hit all 5 scheduled workouts (W03, W07, W11, W15, W21) which felt great for my endurance goals. The variety kept things interesting - from tempo runs to longer steady-state sessions. Diet adherence landed at about 76%, which is right in line with my propensity. I had two days where I went slightly over target (around 2750 kcal) - one after the particularly grueling W15 workout where my hunger was just intense, and another on the weekend when I attended a family gathering. The quad tightness from last week is almost completely resolved thanks to consistent foam rolling and proper warm-ups. Sleep averaged 7.2 hours this week, a slight improvement. I'm noticing my recovery between workouts is getting better, and my resting heart rate has dropped by 2 bpm. The body recomposition is continuing - clothes fit better around the waist while shoulders and chest feel fuller. Budget management was excellent at 47.8 SAR/day average. I'm meal prepping more efficiently now, buying bulk chicken, rice, and seasonal vegetables. One challenge this week was Wednesday evening when work ran late and I almost skipped W11, but I pushed through with a shorter modified version. Overall feeling strong, motivated, and seeing tangible progress in both endurance capacity and body composition."
P19,2026-W03,14,31.6,75.9,2687,7.3,"This week was a strong continuation of my fitness journey with excellent workout adherence (5/5 completed) but faced some dietary challenges. Started the week feeling energized with improved sleep averaging 7.3 hours. Workouts W03, W07, W11, W15, and W21 were all completed with good intensity, though W11 required a slight modification on day 4 due to work running late - I shortened the cooldown but maintained the core intervals.

Diet adherence was around 72% this week, slightly below my typical 75%. Had two significant overage days: Wednesday after W11 (exceeded by ~180 kcal due to post-workout hunger and grabbed an extra protein bar and dates) and Saturday evening social gathering where I had an unplanned dessert (~200 kcal over). The rest of the week I stayed within 50-100 kcal of target, which felt manageable.

Budget performance was excellent at 48.2 SAR/day average - well under my 50 SAR limit. Focused on bulk purchases of chicken, lentils, and seasonal vegetables which helped keep costs down. My intermediate cooking skills allowed me to meal prep effectively on Sunday and Wednesday evenings.

Physically, I'm noticing continued body recomposition. Quads feel strong and recovered from previous tightness. RHR holding steady around 58 bpm. Energy levels remained high throughout the week, likely supported by the consistent 7+ hours of sleep. The endurance-focused workouts (especially W15 and W21) are showing results - I'm recovering faster between intervals and maintaining better form in the final sets.

One minor challenge: experienced some lower back tightness after W21 on Friday, but it resolved with proper stretching and foam rolling. No injuries or setbacks that would impact next week. Overall feeling strong and motivated to continue."
P19,2026-W04,13.8,31.7,75.6,2567,7.3,"Week 4 of 2026 went really well overall. I managed to complete all 5 scheduled workouts (W03, W07, W11, W15, W21) which felt great for maintaining my endurance focus. The W21 workout was particularly challenging - it's a longer endurance session and I definitely felt some fatigue in my legs toward the end, but pushed through. Energy levels stayed high throughout the week, which I attribute to keeping my sleep relatively consistent around 7.2-7.4 hours most nights.

Diet-wise, I hit around 73% adherence this week. Monday and Tuesday were spot-on with my 2500 kcal target, but Wednesday I had a work lunch that wasn't planned and ended up about 220 kcal over. Thursday and Friday I dialed it back in and stayed within range. Saturday was tougher - family gathering with traditional Saudi dishes, and I definitely indulged more than planned, probably around +250 kcal over target. Sunday I compensated a bit and came in slightly under to balance things out.

The meal prep on Sunday helped a lot. I made a big batch of grilled chicken, brown rice, and roasted vegetables which covered lunches for Mon-Thu. My intermediate cooking skills are definitely paying off - I'm getting better at portion control and making meals that hit my macros without being boring. Budget stayed right around 49 SAR/day, well within my 50 SAR limit. Local produce prices were good this week.

Physically, I'm noticing continued improvements in my cardiovascular endurance. My resting heart rate is holding steady in the 57-59 bpm range, and recovery between interval sets feels quicker. The lower back tightness from last week's W21 workout didn't resurface this time - I made sure to do a proper 10-minute stretching routine after that session, focusing on hip flexors and lower back mobility.

One challenge this week was Wednesday's afternoon energy dip. I think it was a combination of the heavier lunch and maybe not hydrating enough in the morning. Made a mental note to be more consistent with water intake, especially on workout days.

Body composition feels like it's moving in the right direction. I can see a bit more definition in my shoulders and upper chest, and my pants fit slightly looser around the waist. At 45-60 age range, I'm really pleased with how my body is responding to this consistent training and nutrition approach.

Looking ahead, I want to maintain this 5-day workout schedule and maybe tighten up the weekend diet adherence a bit. The weekdays are pretty locked in now, but social situations on weekends remain my biggest challenge. Overall though, feeling strong, motivated, and on track with my endurance goals."
P19,2026-W05,13.5,31.9,75.3,2638,7.2,"Week 5 was a solid continuation of my endurance-focused program. I managed to complete all 5 scheduled workouts (W03, W07, W11, W15, W21) despite some mid-week work pressures. The progressive endurance sessions are definitely paying off - I noticed improved stamina during W15 (tempo run) and W21 (long steady-state cardio). 

Diet adherence came in around 71% this week, slightly below my usual 73-75% range. Had three overage days instead of the typical two: Tuesday (+180 kcal from an impromptu coffee meeting with pastries), Thursday (+240 kcal from a business dinner where portion control was difficult), and Sunday (+195 kcal from a family brunch). The weekend continues to be my weak point for dietary discipline, but I'm learning to plan better.

Sleep averaged 7.2 hours, just slightly below my 7.3h baseline. Wednesday night was particularly rough (6.5h) due to a late project deadline, which affected my Thursday workout intensity. I compensated with an earlier bedtime Thursday and Friday.

Budget management was excellent at 48.7 SAR/day average. I've gotten better at meal prepping on Sundays, which helps both adherence and cost control. Bought bulk chicken breast and brown rice at a discount, which stretched the budget nicely.

Physically, I'm feeling strong. RHR remains stable at 57-58 bpm. No injuries or concerning soreness, though my calves were tight after W21 (the long cardio session). I've been more diligent with post-workout stretching and foam rolling. Hydration improved this week - I set phone reminders and hit 2.5-3L most days.

Body composition is trending positively. Visibly leaner around the midsection, and my cardiovascular capacity is noticeably better. I can sustain higher heart rate zones for longer periods without the same fatigue. The endurance goal is definitely being met.

Challenges: Work-related eating situations remain tricky. I need to develop better strategies for business meals - maybe eating a small protein-rich snack beforehand to reduce temptation. Also, I'm considering meal prep containers for the office to avoid cafeteria temptations.

Overall satisfaction: 8/10. Making measurable progress toward endurance goals, staying within budget, and maintaining consistency despite life's curveballs."
P19,2026-W06,13.2,32,74.9,2557,7.1,"Week 6 felt like a solid continuation of my endurance journey, though I'm noticing the cumulative fatigue from consecutive training weeks. The workout combination this week was particularly challenging - W03, W07, W11, W15, and W21 hit different energy systems and I could feel the progression in my cardiovascular capacity. Monday's W03 session felt smooth, my heart rate recovery between intervals has definitely improved. Wednesday's W07 tempo run was tough but manageable, though I noticed my legs felt heavier than usual - probably from the accumulated volume. Friday's W11 hill repeats really tested my mental fortitude; I completed all reps but the last two were a grind. The W15 long slow distance on Saturday was actually meditative and enjoyable, my aerobic base feels much stronger than it did months ago. Sunday's W21 interval session left me properly fatigued but satisfied.

Diet adherence was around 73% this week, which I'm reasonably happy with given my typical challenges. Tuesday I had a client lunch that pushed me over by about 165 kcal - I tried to order smart but the restaurant options were limited. Thursday evening I attended a networking dinner and went over by roughly 210 kcal, though I consciously skipped the dessert course. Saturday I allowed myself a post-long-run treat at a café which added an extra 155 kcal. The other four days I stayed within 50 kcal of target, which felt like a win. My meal prep on Sunday helped tremendously - having grilled chicken, quinoa, and roasted vegetables ready made weekday lunches straightforward.

Sleep averaged 7.1 hours this week, slightly below my usual 7.2. Tuesday night I only got 6.7 hours due to work stress keeping my mind racing, and I definitely felt it during Wednesday's tempo run. The other nights ranged from 7.0 to 7.5 hours. I'm trying to be more disciplined about my evening routine - putting my phone away by 10 PM helps. My resting heart rate has been consistently 56-58 bpm, which suggests good recovery despite the training load.

Physically, I'm seeing continued body recomposition. My clothes fit better, especially around the waist, and I can see more definition in my shoulders and legs. The mirror shows subtle but definite progress. Weight is trending down very gradually, which is appropriate given my endurance focus - I'm not trying to lose weight rapidly, just optimize my power-to-weight ratio. Energy levels throughout the day have been good, no afternoon crashes.

Budget-wise, I spent an average of 47.3 SAR per day, comfortably under my 50 SAR limit. Shopping at the local market for produce and buying chicken and fish in bulk continues to be cost-effective. I did splurge slightly on some higher-quality olive oil (22 SAR) which will last several weeks.

Challenges this week: The calf tightness from previous weeks flared up slightly after Sunday's intervals. I spent extra time foam rolling and stretching, and it's manageable but something I need to monitor. Also, I'm noticing some mental fatigue from the training volume - five quality sessions per week is demanding when combined with work responsibilities. I might need to be more strategic about recovery weeks going forward.

Positives: My running economy feels significantly improved. Paces that felt hard two months ago now feel conversational. I'm genuinely enjoying the training process, which is crucial for long-term adherence. My hydration has been excellent this week - I set phone reminders and consistently hit 3+ liters per day. Overall, I feel like I'm building a robust aerobic engine and the consistency is paying dividends. Looking forward to continuing this progression while being mindful of recovery needs."
P19,2026-W07,13,32.1,74.7,2661,7,"Week 7 of 2026 presented a solid training block with all five scheduled workouts completed, though I'm noticing some accumulated fatigue that required careful management. The diet adherence came in at approximately 71%, slightly below my typical range, with four overage days totaling around 620 excess calories across the week. Monday started strong with W03 (easy aerobic run) feeling smooth despite some residual calf tightness from last week—foam rolling before and after really helped. Tuesday's W07 (tempo intervals) was challenging; work stress limited sleep to 6.5 hours the night before, and I could feel the difference in my recovery between intervals. Had a client lunch that pushed me 180 kcal over target, but I made reasonable choices given the circumstances.

Wednesday was a rest day that I desperately needed. Focused on active recovery with stretching and mobility work. Sleep bounced back to 7.3 hours, which helped significantly. Thursday brought W11 (hill repeats), and while my legs felt heavy initially, the workout quality was good—my heart rate response is definitely improving, staying lower at equivalent efforts compared to a month ago. Another networking dinner pushed me 195 kcal over, but I'm learning to navigate these professional obligations better. Friday's W15 (long steady run) was probably my best workout of the week. Weather was perfect, legs felt strong, and I maintained a comfortable pace for the full duration. RHR Friday morning was 57 bpm, showing good adaptation despite the week's stress.

Saturday's W21 (lactate threshold run) was tough—cumulative fatigue was evident, and I had to really focus on form and breathing. Treated myself to a café stop post-run which added 145 kcal, but felt mentally necessary. Sunday was full rest, and I prioritized sleep (7.8 hours) and gentle stretching. Overall body composition continues trending positively—clothes fitting better, visible definition improving. Budget management was excellent at 46.8 SAR/day average. The main challenges this week were managing work-related eating situations and accumulated training fatigue. I'm wondering if I should consider a recovery week soon, as the intensity is building and I want to avoid overtraining. Hydration remained strong at 3+ liters daily. Calf tightness is mostly resolved but requires continued attention. Mental engagement with training is still high, though I'm feeling the need for some variety in my running routes."
P19,2026-W08,12.7,32.3,74.4,2687,6.9,"Week 8 turned out to be a challenging but ultimately successful training block. I entered the week with some residual fatigue from the previous 5 weeks of consistent training, and it definitely showed up during certain workouts. The accumulated fatigue I'd been noticing became more pronounced, especially during the mid-week tempo run (W11) where my legs felt heavy from the start.

Monday's recovery run (W03) felt good—exactly what I needed to shake out the weekend's efforts. Tuesday's interval session (W07) was tough but manageable, though I noticed my heart rate was climbing faster than usual for the same paces. By Wednesday, I was questioning whether I should take an extra rest day, but I pushed through with Thursday's threshold work (W15). That session was probably my weakest of the week; I had to dial back the intensity slightly to complete the intervals.

Friday's rest day was perfectly timed, and I made sure to prioritize sleep and nutrition. Saturday's long run (W21) started rough but I found my rhythm after about 30 minutes. The last 5k actually felt strong, which gave me confidence. Sunday I took as an active recovery day with light stretching and foam rolling.

Diet-wise, I had three overage days this week. Wednesday I attended a work lunch where portion control was difficult (+165 kcal), Friday evening I had a small social dinner (+120 kcal), and Sunday I indulged in a post-recovery brunch (+140 kcal). Overall adherence was around 68%—lower than I'd like but realistic given my social commitments. I stayed well within budget at approximately 47.2 SAR/day.

Sleep was inconsistent. I averaged 6.9 hours, with two particularly rough nights (Monday 6.3h due to work deadline, Thursday 6.5h from pre-race anxiety about Saturday's long run). The other nights I managed 7-7.5 hours which helped with recovery.

Physically, I'm definitely seeing continued improvements in body composition. My clothes fit better, and I can see more definition in my legs and core. However, the fatigue is real—my resting heart rate crept up slightly to 57-59 bpm range, and I felt more muscle soreness than usual, particularly in my calves and quads. I was religious about foam rolling and stretching, which prevented any acute issues.

The mental side was interesting this week. I had moments of doubt, especially mid-week when everything felt hard. But completing Saturday's long run despite the accumulated fatigue gave me a real confidence boost. I'm learning to distinguish between 'tired' and 'injured,' which is crucial.

Looking ahead, I absolutely need to program a recovery week soon—probably within the next 1-2 weeks. The cumulative load is catching up with me, and while I'm adapting well, I can feel I'm approaching a point where the risk of overtraining or injury increases. My cardiovascular fitness continues to improve (lower HR at given paces, faster recovery), but my musculoskeletal system needs some down time.

Positives: Completed all 5 planned workouts, maintained good nutrition discipline despite challenges, stayed under budget, no injuries, continued body recomposition. Areas for improvement: Sleep consistency, better meal planning around social events, and recognizing when to scale back intensity versus pushing through."
P19,2026-W09,12.4,32.3,74,2618,6.8,"Week 9 proved to be a critical juncture in my training cycle. Coming off Week 8 with accumulated fatigue and elevated RHR, I knew recovery needed prioritization alongside continued progression. The week started Monday with W03 (Easy Run 45min) which felt surprisingly manageable despite the 6.3h sleep—legs were heavy initially but loosened up after 15 minutes. Tuesday's W07 (Tempo Run 50min) was where fatigue really showed; I had to dial back the tempo segments by about 10-15 seconds per km to maintain form. My quads were screaming by minute 35, and I seriously considered cutting it short, but pushed through with modified intensity.

Wednesday was a rest day that I desperately needed. Foam rolled for 25 minutes focusing on IT bands and calves, which were incredibly tight. The work lunch situation repeated itself—client meeting at a restaurant where I exceeded my calorie target by about 180 kcal. I'm noticing a pattern where professional obligations clash with nutrition goals, and I need a better strategy here, maybe pre-eating a protein-rich snack before these meetings.

Thursday's W11 (Hill Repeats 40min) was brutal. Six repeats on my usual gradient felt like climbing Everest. Heart rate spiked faster than normal, confirming my elevated baseline RHR concerns. Completed all repeats but the last two were significantly slower. Friday's W15 (Threshold Run 55min) required mental fortitude I wasn't sure I had. Split it into three threshold blocks with extended recovery, rather than the prescribed continuous effort. Evening social dinner added another 135 kcal over target—grilled salmon and vegetables, so quality calories at least.

Saturday's W21 (Long Run 90min) was the week's defining moment. First 30 minutes felt like running through mud—legs heavy, breathing labored, seriously doubted completion. Around minute 40, something shifted. Maybe endorphins kicked in, maybe my body finally warmed up properly, but the final 50 minutes felt almost euphoric. Finished strong, negative split the second half, and felt genuinely accomplished. This run reminded me why I'm doing this.

Sunday recovery was intentional—gentle 20-minute walk, extensive stretching, and a slightly indulgent brunch with the family (+155 kcal over target, but worth it for mental health). Sleep averaged 6.8 hours across the week, slight improvement from last week but still suboptimal. Two nights hit 7+ hours which made noticeable differences in recovery quality.

Diet adherence landed at 71%—better than Week 8's 68% but still room for improvement. Four overage days totaling approximately 470 excess calories across the week. Budget management was excellent at 46.8 SAR/day, well under my 50 SAR limit. I've gotten smarter about bulk buying proteins and seasonal vegetables.

Physically, I'm seeing continued body recomposition. Muscle definition in legs is noticeably improved, core feels tighter, and my running shorts are fitting differently around the waist and thighs. Weight dropped slightly (0.4kg) but muscle mass held steady, suggesting fat loss which aligns with visual changes. RHR remains elevated at 57-59 bpm range—this is my body's clear signal that a recovery week is imminent.

The cumulative fatigue is real and undeniable. Morning stiffness is taking longer to resolve, DOMS persisting 48+ hours post-workout, and mental energy for training is waning. However, cardiovascular fitness continues improving—my easy pace heart rate is 5-7 bpm lower than a month ago at equivalent speeds. I'm genuinely faster and more efficient.

Mentally, this week was a rollercoaster. Tuesday and Thursday had me questioning my training plan and considering backing off. Saturday's long run completely reversed that mindset—I felt powerful, capable, and excited about upcoming challenges. This emotional variability is new for me and likely connected to accumulated fatigue and marginal sleep.

Key learnings: (1) I MUST implement a recovery week within the next 7-10 days—my body is screaming for it. (2) Work meal situations need a proactive strategy, not reactive damage control. (3) Long runs are becoming my confidence anchor—even when they start rough, finishing strong provides immense psychological benefit. (4) Sleep remains the limiting factor; 7+ hours consistently would transform my recovery capacity.

Looking ahead, I'm planning Week 10 as a deliberate recovery week—reduce volume by 40%, eliminate intensity work, prioritize sleep hygiene, and allow my body to absorb these training adaptations. The alternative is risking injury or burnout, neither of which serves my endurance goals. I'm learning to listen to my body's signals rather than just following the plan blindly—this maturity in training approach feels like progress itself."

I struggled a bit with the advanced workouts - they're really tough for my beginner level and I had to modify several exercises or use lighter weights than programmed. The jareesh dinner became my favorite meal by mid-week. I missed two workout days because of fatigue and one day I added extra almonds at lunch because I was really hungry. The labneh snack is perfect though - easy to prepare even with my basic cooking skills. I can feel my body adjusting but it's slow going."
P20,2025-W47,32.7,20.72,63.6,1847,7,"Completed my week 47 diet and workout plan with mixed results. Started Monday motivated after reviewing the plan, but by Wednesday I was already feeling the challenge of sticking to 1976 calories daily. The diet itself wasn't terrible - I appreciate the Saudi-friendly options - but my beginner cooking skills made meal prep take longer than expected, especially the protein-heavy meals. I managed to complete the diet fully on 4 days (Monday, Tuesday, Friday, Sunday), which matches my 58% adherence tendency pretty well.

Workout-wise, I only completed 2 out of 3 sessions. Did W33 (Push) on Tuesday and W29 (Pull) on Thursday, but had to skip W21 (Legs) on Saturday because my legs were still sore from the Push day squats. I'm realizing the 'Advanced' level workouts are way too intense for my beginner fitness level - I had to reduce weights by about 40% on most exercises and still struggled. The chest press and lat pulldowns were particularly humbling.

I went over my calorie target on Wednesday and Saturday by about 150 calories each day - added extra almonds as snacks and an extra date portion when I was really hungry. My 35 SAR daily budget was mostly sufficient, though I had to be strategic with protein sources. Bought chicken breast in bulk and eggs which helped.

Sleep stayed consistent around 7 hours, which I'm happy about. Muscle soreness was pretty intense mid-week, especially in my upper body. By Friday I was feeling it in my back and shoulders. Overall, I feel like I gave it an honest effort given my constraints, but I'm not expecting dramatic changes. Maybe lost a tiny bit of water weight, but nothing significant."
P20,2025-W48,32.3,20.65,62.8,2008,7,"Week 2 (W48) complete and honestly, I'm feeling the cumulative effects now. Started at 63.6kg and managed to drop to 62.8kg, which is encouraging but I know some of this is water weight. The good news is I actually improved my adherence slightly - hit 4 out of 7 days on diet compliance again, but this time I was more mindful about my 'off' days and only added about 100 extra calories instead of 150.

Workouts were TOUGH. I attempted all three this week (W33, W29, W21) but had to modify heavily. W33 (Upper Body) left me sore for three days - I'm talking can't-lift-my-arms-to-wash-my-hair sore. I've learned I absolutely MUST scale these 'Advanced' workouts down to beginner modifications. Did W29 (Core) on Wednesday with reduced reps and it was manageable. By Friday's W21 (Legs), I was still dealing with residual soreness but pushed through with bodyweight-only versions of the exercises.

The 7-hour sleep schedule is my saving grace - I'm religious about it now because I notice if I get less, my hunger signals go haywire and adherence drops. Budget-wise, I'm getting smarter. Spent about 240 SAR this week (staying just under my 245 SAR weekly budget) by buying chicken thighs instead of breasts, using more eggs and lentils for protein, and batch-cooking on Sunday.

The muscle soreness is real though. My upper body is constantly tight, and I'm learning that at 45+ and beginner fitness level, recovery is just as important as the work itself. I'm considering adding a rest day between workouts or doing very light movement on off days. The 147g protein target is challenging on my budget but I'm managing with strategic shopping.

Body composition changes are subtle but there - clothes fit slightly better around the waist, though the scale doesn't show dramatic changes. I think I'm in this for the long haul and need to adjust my expectations. My cooking skills are improving out of necessity - made a decent chicken stir-fry and egg-based meals that hit my macros without breaking the bank.

Biggest barrier remains the workout intensity mismatch. I need beginner-appropriate programming, not scaled-down advanced workouts. But I'm proud I showed up three times this week despite the soreness."
P20,2025-W49,32,20.75,62.5,2138,7,"Week 49 is complete, and honestly, it's been a mixed bag. I started the week feeling optimistic after recognizing recovery as a priority last week, but reality hit hard. My adherence dropped to about 43% this week (3 out of 7 days compliant), which is lower than my W48 performance. The persistent DOMS from previous weeks finally started easing mid-week, but then W33's upper body work brought it right back.

Monday started well - I hit my macros and completed W33 (Upper Body Strength), though I had to scale the push-ups to wall push-ups and used lighter dumbbells than prescribed. Tuesday I was SO sore that I added about 150 extra calories through some comfort snacking (dates and nuts). Wednesday I managed to stay compliant and tackled W29 (Lower Body & Core), but my quads were screaming by evening.

Thursday through Saturday were rough. Work stress ramped up, and I found myself reaching for quick carbs - extra flatbread here, some biscuits there. I exceeded my calorie target by 120-180 kcal on those days. My cooking skills are still basic, and when I'm tired, meal prep feels overwhelming. I did complete W21 (Full Body Circuit) on Friday, but I had to take extra rest periods and skip the jump squats entirely, doing regular squats instead.

Budget-wise, I spent about 238 SAR this week, staying just under my 245 SAR limit. I'm getting better at finding affordable protein sources - bought chicken thighs instead of breasts, and found a good deal on lentils at the local market.

The positive: I maintained my 7 hours of sleep every night, and I can feel my body slowly adapting. My clothes fit slightly better, especially around my waist. I'm learning to listen to my body more - when the DOMS is too intense, I scale back rather than pushing through and risking injury.

The challenge: My adherence propensity of 58% is pretty accurate - I'm hovering right around there. Being 45+ and a beginner means recovery takes longer than I'd like. I need to plan better for those high-stress work days. Maybe prep some compliant snacks in advance?

Looking ahead: I want to get back to that 57% adherence from W48. I'm thinking of doing some meal prep on Sunday evenings to make weekday compliance easier. Also considering lighter workout modifications to manage DOMS better."
P20,2025-W50,31.7,20.85,62.2,1987,7,"Week 50 was a mixed bag, honestly. Started strong on Monday and Tuesday with full diet compliance and got through W33 upper body workout with fewer modifications than last time - managed knee push-ups instead of wall push-ups, which felt like progress! But Wednesday hit me hard with work deadlines and I grabbed a shawarma wrap (extra 180 kcal) instead of my prepped lunch. Thursday's W29 lower body was tough - still skipping jump squats but did all the other moves. Friday I was back on track with meals, feeling good. Weekend was the challenge - Saturday's W21 full body went okay but I was exhausted, and Sunday I completely fell off the diet wagon with family gathering (estimated 250+ extra kcal from desserts I couldn't refuse). The stress-day meal prep issue continues to haunt me. On the positive side, DOMS wasn't as brutal this week, recovery seems to be improving slightly. Sleep stayed consistent at 7 hours. Clothes definitely feel looser around my midsection, which keeps me motivated despite the diet struggles. Budget was 242 SAR this week, just slightly over but manageable. I think my body is adapting to the workouts but I really need to crack the stress-eating pattern."
P20,2025-W51,31.2,21,61.7,2056,7,"Week 51 was challenging but showed continued progress. Started the week motivated after seeing waist measurements shrink, but mid-week work stress triggered familiar eating patterns. I managed 4 out of 7 days compliant with the diet (57% adherence, up from 43% last week!), which feels like a real achievement given the holiday season approaching.

Monday and Tuesday were solid - followed the meal plan closely, hit my protein targets, and felt energized. Wednesday the stress hit hard at work (year-end reports) and I grabbed an extra shawarma wrap around 3pm, adding about 400 kcal. Thursday I got back on track. Friday was good until evening when neighbors brought over kunafa - I had a small piece (maybe 250 kcal extra). Weekend was mixed: Saturday compliant, Sunday had a family pre-holiday gathering with too much kabsa and desserts (estimated 350 kcal over).

Workouts felt AMAZING this week. Completed all 3 sessions (W33, W29, W21) with fewer modifications than ever. The knee push-ups from W33 are getting easier - I did 8 in a row without stopping! Still skipping jump squats in W29 due to knee concerns, but I added an extra set of regular squats instead. W21 cardio intervals were tough but manageable. Recovery time between sets is down to about 45 seconds now, much better than the 75+ seconds I needed in earlier weeks.

DOMS is noticeably less severe. My legs were sore after W29 but I could still climb stairs normally the next day. Sleep remained consistent at 7 hours, though Wednesday night was restless (work anxiety). Energy levels are higher overall, and I'm noticing my clothes fitting better around the waist and hips.

Budget was 238 SAR this week, just under my 245 SAR target. The extra food on non-compliant days was mostly from existing pantry items or shared meals, so it didn't impact budget as much as expected.

Main barrier remains stress-eating, especially mid-week work pressure. But I'm learning to recognize the pattern and sometimes catch myself before reaching for extra food. The physical progress (visible waist reduction, easier workouts, better recovery) is keeping me motivated. I feel like I'm finally building sustainable habits, even if I'm not perfect every day."
P20,2025-W52,31.3,21.1,62.1,2089,6.9,"Week 52 was challenging but I managed to maintain my momentum despite the holiday period! Started strong with good adherence Monday-Tuesday, then hit some bumps mid-week with Christmas Eve celebrations and family gatherings. I'm really proud that I completed all 3 workouts even with the festive chaos - my knee push-ups are getting stronger (managed 10 reps on Monday!) and I'm feeling more confident with the movements. The holiday food was harder to navigate than regular stress-eating because it felt rude to decline family dishes, especially my sister's kunafa and mom's kabsa. I tried smaller portions but still went over on 4 days. Sleep was inconsistent - Christmas Eve I only got 5.5 hours because of late-night preparations, but I compensated with 8 hours on Christmas Day. My energy during workouts stayed good, and I'm noticing my endurance improving - rest periods are consistently around 45 seconds now. The scale showed a small increase by end of week which I expected with the celebrations, but my clothes still fit the same so I'm not discouraged. Budget went slightly over (248 SAR) due to some pre-made holiday foods when I was too busy to cook. Looking forward to getting back to routine in the new year, but I'm genuinely happy I didn't completely derail during what's typically my hardest time of year."
P20,2026-W01,31,21.2,61.8,1947,6.9,"Week 1 of 2026 is complete! I'm honestly relieved to be back in a normal routine after the holiday chaos. The first few days were tough - I really felt the sugar withdrawal and my body was craving all those holiday treats. By Wednesday I hit my stride though.

Workouts went surprisingly well! W33 on Monday was challenging but doable - those dumbbell exercises really work the whole body. I managed all three rounds with the 3kg weights I have, though my shoulders were burning by the end. Wednesday's W29 felt great - I love the bodyweight circuit style, and I'm definitely getting stronger with those knee push-ups. Hit 12 reps this time! Friday's W21 was tough on the legs - those jump squats are no joke, but I modified by doing them slower and focusing on form rather than height.

Diet-wise, I stuck to plan on 4 out of 7 days which is actually an improvement over my holiday week! Monday and Tuesday I was fully compliant and felt proud. Wednesday I added about 200 extra calories - had some leftover Arabic coffee with dates at a friend's house (couldn't say no without being rude). Thursday was perfect again. Friday evening I went over by about 400 calories - we had a small family gathering and I indulged in some kunafa. Saturday was back on track. Sunday I slipped again, added maybe 300 calories with some evening snacking while watching TV - old habit creeping back.

Sleep was consistent around 6.9 hours most nights, though I got a full 8 hours on Saturday which felt amazing. I notice I'm less hungry and more energized when I sleep better. My knees feel good, no major DOMS this week. The 35 SAR daily budget worked well - I'm getting better at meal planning with basic ingredients like chicken, eggs, vegetables, and rice.

Weight is down slightly which is encouraging, though I know it's mostly water weight from cutting back on salt and sugar after the holidays. I can feel my clothes fitting a tiny bit better around the waist. The scale showed 61.8kg this morning which made me smile! My main victory this week was getting back into the routine and completing all three planned workouts. That consistency is what I'm most proud of."
P20,2026-W02,30.7,21.3,61.4,1987,6.8,"Week 2 of 2026 complete! This week was a real test of my commitment. Started strong Monday and Tuesday with perfect diet adherence and solid workouts. My knee push-ups are getting easier - I managed 14 reps on Monday which felt amazing! Wednesday was tricky though - met a friend for coffee and ended up having a slice of carrot cake. I tried to compensate by eating lighter at dinner but still went over by about 180 kcal.

Thursday's workout (W29) was challenging. Those jump squats are no joke, even modified. My knees felt okay but I was cautious. Friday was a disaster calorie-wise - family gathering with kunafa and I couldn't resist. Probably added 350-400 kcal over target. I felt guilty but reminded myself that family time matters too.

Saturday I got back on track with a great 7.8 hour sleep and clean eating. Sunday's workout (W21) went well, though I was tired from the week. I did snack in the evening while watching TV - probably 250 kcal of mixed nuts and dates. Not terrible choices but still over budget.

Sleep averaged 6.8 hours which is slightly down from last week's 6.9. I need to prioritize getting to bed earlier. The 4am wake-ups for Fajr are non-negotiable, so I really need lights out by 9pm.

Budget-wise, I spent 238 SAR this week - right on target! I'm getting better at meal planning and buying in bulk. The local vegetable market saves me so much compared to the supermarket.

Physically, I feel stronger. My squat depth is noticeably better and I'm not getting as winded during cardio intervals. The scale shows a small drop but I know it's early days. My clothes feel slightly looser around the waist which is encouraging.

Challenges remain: social eating situations, evening snacking when I'm tired, and getting consistent 7+ hour sleep. But I'm proud that I completed all 3 workouts and had 4 compliant diet days out of 7. That's 57% adherence which matches my propensity. I'm building sustainable habits, not chasing perfection."
P20,2026-W03,30.4,21.4,61,2087,6.7,"Week 3 felt like a real test of my consistency, and I'm honestly proud of how I managed despite some setbacks. I started the week motivated after seeing those strength gains from last week, but life threw a few curveballs my way.

Monday and Tuesday were solid days - I stuck to my meal plan, hit my calorie targets, and completed W33 on Monday evening. The workout felt challenging but doable, and I'm getting better at pacing myself through the circuits. My push-ups are definitely stronger now, which feels amazing.

Wednesday was tough. A colleague invited me for coffee after work, and I ended up having a slice of date cake with my cappuccino. I tried to compensate by eating a lighter dinner, but I still went over by about 200 calories. I felt guilty at first, but then reminded myself that social connections matter too.

Thursday I got back on track completely - meal prepped my lunch, stayed within budget, and felt energized. Friday's W29 workout was excellent; I'm really enjoying the variety in these routines. But then Friday evening, my sister brought kunafa for a family gathering. I had a small piece (okay, maybe medium-sized), and that added about 400 calories I hadn't planned for. The sugar rush was real, and I felt a bit sluggish afterward.

The weekend was mixed. Saturday I was compliant with my diet and completed W21, though I felt a bit tired from the week. My knees felt good during the modified jump squats - I'm glad I'm being cautious there. Sunday evening was my downfall - I was exhausted from a long day of household chores, and I mindlessly snacked on mixed nuts and dates while watching TV. Added probably 280 calories without really enjoying them, which frustrated me.

Sleep was inconsistent this week - averaged about 6.7 hours, with one night at only 5.9 hours after staying up late helping my daughter with a project. I definitely notice the connection between poor sleep and my evening snacking tendency.

The positives: I completed all 3 scheduled workouts, my strength continues to improve (I did 15 push-ups in a row during W29!), and I stayed within my budget at 233 SAR for the week. My clothes feel slightly looser around the waist, which is encouraging even if the scale doesn't show dramatic changes.

The challenges: Social eating situations, evening fatigue leading to mindless snacking, and inconsistent sleep. I need to plan better for social events and maybe prep some healthy evening snacks for those tired moments.

Overall, 4 out of 7 compliant days feels about right for where I am in my journey. I'm not perfect, but I'm consistent with exercise and making more mindful choices most of the time. The scale showed a small drop, and I feel like my body composition is slowly shifting in the right direction."
P20,2026-W04,30.1,21.5,60.6,2045,6.5,"Week 4 felt like a real test of consistency. Started strong on Monday and Tuesday, hitting my diet targets and feeling energized after workouts. The push-up progress from last week carried over - I managed 17 consecutive during Wednesday's W29 session, which felt amazing! However, Wednesday afternoon brought the familiar pattern: poor sleep Tuesday night (only 5.8 hours due to work stress) led directly to evening snacking on leftover dates and almonds, adding about 320 extra calories. I'm really seeing how sleep directly impacts my willpower.

Thursday I course-corrected well, staying within budget and prepping simple meals. Friday's W33 workout was solid despite some knee sensitivity during the modified jump squats - I reduced the range of motion slightly and it helped. The weekend was mixed: Saturday I attended a family gathering where I had a small portion of kabsa and one piece of baklava (about +250 kcal over target), but I made conscious choices to have smaller portions than I would have a month ago. Sunday I was back on track.

The scale showed a small drop by week's end, and my clothes continue to feel looser around the waist. I'm noticing more definition in my shoulders, which is motivating. The budget worked out to 238 SAR - slightly over by 3 SAR due to buying pre-cut vegetables to save time, but worth it for adherence. Sleep averaged 6.5 hours this week, with two rough nights that clearly correlated with my slip-ups.

Key wins: 4/7 diet-compliant days (57% again - consistent!), completed all 3 scheduled workouts with improved performance, and I'm developing better awareness of my trigger patterns. The connection between sleep, stress, and evening snacking is undeniable. I need to protect my sleep better - maybe setting a firmer bedtime routine. Overall, I feel like I'm building sustainable habits even if progress feels gradual."
P20,2026-W05,29.8,21.6,60.2,1912,6.4,"Week 5 complete! This week felt like a real test of consistency, and I'm proud I pushed through despite some familiar challenges. The sleep-snacking connection hit me hard again - Tuesday and Thursday were rough after getting under 6 hours of sleep, and I found myself reaching for dates and trail mix in the evenings both times. I managed to stay closer to my calorie targets on the other days though, which felt like a win.

Workouts were solid! All three sessions completed as scheduled. W33 on Monday went smoothly - my knee felt much better this week, so I did full-range jump squats without modifications. Wednesday's W29 was intense but amazing - I pushed out 19 consecutive push-ups! That's 2 more than last week and 4 more than when I started. My shoulders are definitely getting stronger, and I can see more definition when I look in the mirror. Friday's W21 left me pleasantly exhausted.

The big struggle this week was Thursday - I only got 5.7 hours of sleep Wednesday night due to work deadline stress, and Thursday I was dragging all day. Ended up about 280 calories over target with evening snacking on labneh, crackers, and some chocolate my colleague brought to the office. I tried to compensate Friday by being extra mindful, which helped.

Saturday was my daughter's birthday celebration at home. I planned ahead and portioned my kabsa carefully, had one small piece of cake, and surprisingly stayed within about 100 calories of target. That felt like real progress in managing social/family eating situations compared to previous weeks.

Budget-wise, I spent 241 SAR this week - 6 SAR over my 235 SAR weekly budget. I bought pre-marinated chicken breast which cost more but saved me 30 minutes of prep time twice this week. Worth it given my energy levels. Also stocked up on frozen vegetables which are helping me hit fiber targets more consistently.

Sleep averaged 6.4 hours this week - slightly below my recent 6.5 average. Two nights below 6 hours (Tuesday 5.9, Wednesday 5.7) directly correlated with my non-compliant eating days. I really need to prioritize this. I'm going to try setting a firm 10:30 PM phone-away time next week.

Body changes: My jeans are noticeably looser around the waist, and I had to tighten my belt one notch. Energy levels are generally good except on the low-sleep days. The scale moved down slightly, which is encouraging. My clothes are fitting better, and I feel stronger during daily activities like carrying groceries.

Overall: 5/7 diet-compliant days (71% - up from 57% last week!), 3/3 workouts completed. The pattern is clear - when I sleep better, I eat better. Next week I'm focusing on getting to bed 30 minutes earlier and seeing if I can break the fatigue-snacking cycle."
P20,2026-W06,29.3,21.9,59.9,1989,6.5,"Week 6 complete! This was a challenging week with mixed results, but I'm learning so much about my patterns. Started strong Monday and Tuesday with perfect adherence - the bedtime routine I planned (herbal tea at 9:30pm, phone away by 10pm) actually helped me get 7+ hours both nights and I had zero cravings. Wednesday's workout (W33) felt powerful - hit 21 consecutive push-ups, new personal record! 

Thursday was my breaking point. Only slept 5.8 hours due to a work deadline, and by 8pm I was standing in front of the fridge eating leftover grilled chicken straight from the container, then moved to almonds, then found myself with a spoon in the labneh. Estimated +320 kcal over target. I recognized it happening but couldn't stop - that sleep deprivation hunger is like a different beast entirely.

Friday I got back on track with W29 workout, though my legs were heavy. Saturday was my daughter's volleyball tournament - packed my meals but the concession stand shawarma smell was torture. Stayed compliant though! Sunday (W21 workout) I felt strongest - my jump squats have so much more power now, and I can feel my glutes activating properly.

The scale barely moved, which was initially frustrating, but my jeans are noticeably looser in the waist and my sports bra fits differently - there's actual shoulder muscle definition now. My husband commented that my posture looks different. I think I'm trading fat for muscle, which the measurements seem to confirm.

Budget was tight at 247 SAR - had to buy more eggs and chicken breast mid-week. The frozen vegetable bulk buy from last week saved me. Sleep averaged 6.5 hours (barely hit my target), but those two nights with 7+ hours proved that when I sleep well, eating is effortless. When I sleep poorly, it's a battle.

Biggest win: 5/7 compliant days, and the two non-compliant days I caught myself faster and did less damage than previous weeks. I'm getting better at the mental game. All 3 workouts completed, push-up PR, and visible body changes even without major scale movement. 

For Week 7: Double down on that bedtime routine, especially before work-heavy days. Maybe prep some cut vegetables for those danger moments when I'm tired and hunting for something crunchy. The discipline is building, slowly but surely."
P20,2026-W07,28.9,22.1,59.6,1908,6.4,"Week 7 is wrapped! This was a mixed week that really highlighted how much my sleep dictates everything else. I started strong with good adherence Monday through Wednesday, nailing all three workouts and staying on plan. My push-ups hit 23 consecutive on Monday - that's a 2-rep gain again and I'm honestly amazed at this progression. The W33 workout felt powerful, and my shoulders are visibly more defined now.

Thursday was rough. Only got 5.5 hours of sleep due to my daughter having a stomach bug - I was up with her twice during the night. By 3pm I was ravenous and made poor choices: grabbed a shawarma wrap on the way home (didn't have prepped veggies ready) and then snacked on dates and cheese at night. That put me about 380 kcal over target. I recognized the sleep-eating pattern immediately but couldn't course-correct in the moment.

Friday I got back on track despite still being tired. My W21 workout was solid - jump squats felt explosive and my glute activation is noticeably better. Saturday I did well until evening when we had family over and I had extra rice with the kabsa. Not terrible, just about 110 kcal over.

Sunday was perfect adherence - I implemented my bedtime routine Saturday night, got 7.2 hours of sleep, and had zero cravings all day. This pattern is so clear now: good sleep = easy adherence.

My jeans are definitely looser and I had to tighten my belt one notch this week. My husband said my back looks ""more athletic"" which made me feel great. The scale barely moved but I can see changes in the mirror - my waist is smaller and my arms look toned. I think I'm building muscle while losing fat.

Budget was 253 SAR this week - I went over by 18 because of Thursday's shawarma and having to restock protein mid-week again. I need to buy in bulk to save money. Sleep averaged 6.4 hours, just slightly below my 6.5 target, mainly due to Thursday's disruption.

For Week 8, I'm committing to: 1) Prep cut veggies in containers for sleep-deprived emergencies, 2) Bedtime routine every night by 9:45pm, 3) Buy chicken and eggs in bulk to stay under budget. The push-up gains are motivating me to keep going!"
P20,2026-W08,28.3,22.4,59.4,1852,6.5,"Week 8 complete! This week felt like a real test of the systems I've been building. The bulk protein purchase I planned really paid off - having pre-portioned chicken and ground beef meant I could grab something compliant even when exhausted. I managed 5 out of 7 days on diet, which matches my Week 7 performance. The two non-compliant days were different from last week though - Monday I went over by about 200 kcal (had extra labneh with breakfast because I was genuinely hungry after the Sunday workout), and Thursday I added a small piece of date cake at a neighbor's gathering (+150 kcal). Neither felt like crisis eating, more like conscious choices.

Workouts were solid - completed all three (Monday W33, Wednesday W29, Friday W21). The push-ups are getting exciting! I hit 25 consecutive on Friday, which is 2 more than last week. My form is staying tight too. The jump squats in W21 felt powerful - I'm definitely generating more force from my glutes. My husband said my legs look 'carved' when I was getting ready for bed Wednesday.

Sleep averaged 6.5 hours this week, which is back on target after last week's Thursday disruption. I stuck to the bedtime routine 5 nights out of 7, and those nights I was asleep by 10:45pm. The two nights I skipped it (Tuesday and Saturday), I scrolled on my phone and didn't fall asleep until after midnight.

Budget came in at 238 SAR - just 3 over! The bulk purchase strategy worked. I bought 3kg chicken breast and 2kg ground beef on Sunday for 95 SAR, then just needed vegetables, eggs, and dairy through the week.

Body-wise, I'm seeing continued changes. The belt notch from last week still fits comfortably - maybe even a tiny bit loose. My shoulders have visible definition even when I'm not flexing. I caught myself in the mirror at the gym Friday and almost didn't recognize my back. The scale hasn't moved much, but I can see I'm trading fat for muscle.

The pre-cut vegetable strategy I mentioned last week helped once - Wednesday night I was tired and just grabbed the cucumber and pepper sticks I'd prepped Sunday. Paired with some grilled chicken and I had a compliant dinner in 5 minutes.

One challenge: my daughter had a minor cold again Tuesday (nothing serious), but it reminded me how quickly my routine can derail. I managed it better this time - had her rest, gave her fluids, and still got my own meal prep done during her nap.

Looking ahead, I want to push for 6/7 diet days next week. I think it's doable if I keep the bulk prep going and maybe add one more emergency meal option - thinking pre-made turkey meatballs I can reheat quickly."
P20,2026-W09,27.8,22.7,59.2,1847,6.5,"Week 9 complete! This was my strongest week yet in terms of consistency and mental clarity. I hit 6/7 diet days (85.7% adherence - exceeded my target!), completed all 3 workouts, and the turkey meatball prep strategy I planned last week was a total game-changer. Monday's W33 workout was brutal but I pushed through 27 consecutive push-ups - that's +2 from last week and my 4th consecutive week of gains. My shoulders are visibly rounder now, and my husband actually asked if I've been doing something different because my arms look 'defined' even in long sleeves.

The only non-compliant day was Thursday when my daughter's school had a parent event with traditional sweets. I had two pieces of baklava (+180 kcal over target) but I made a conscious decision rather than mindless eating, which felt like progress. I also noticed I didn't spiral into 'well, the day is ruined' thinking like I used to. I just got back on track for dinner.

Wednesday's W29 workout was where I really felt my jump squat power improving - I could feel the explosive strength in my glutes and quads. Friday's W21 felt almost easy compared to Week 1, which is wild to think about. My endurance has improved so much.

Sleep was solid at 6.5 hours average. I used my bedtime routine 6/7 nights (only skipped Saturday because we had late family visitors). The correlation between my routine and sleep quality is undeniable now. Budget came in at 232 SAR - the turkey meatball batch (made 40 on Sunday for 52 SAR) plus my regular bulk chicken and vegetables kept me well under target. Having those meatballs in the freezer meant I had zero 'what do I eat?' panic moments.

Body composition changes are accelerating. My work pants that were snug in January are now loose in the waist but tighter in the thighs (muscle!). I can see the separation between my shoulder and upper arm muscle. My daughter said I look 'strong like the women in her PE teacher's posters' which made me tear up a bit. The scale barely moved but my body is completely different.

One challenge: post-workout hunger is real. After Monday's session I was ravenous and had to really focus on eating my planned meals slowly. I'm learning that protein immediately after helps, and I've started keeping hard-boiled eggs ready. Next week I want to maintain this 6/7 diet adherence and maybe experiment with a pre-workout snack to see if it helps with the post-workout hunger. Feeling strong, capable, and genuinely excited about Week 10."

The shakshuka breakfast was delicious and easy to make, which helped me stay on track in the mornings. I struggled with the advanced gym workouts - they were honestly too difficult for my beginner fitness level. I could only complete about 60% of the exercises properly and had to modify or skip some movements. The lamb kofta took longer to prepare than expected with my limited cooking skills, so I simplified it a couple of times. I felt hungry between meals on some days, especially after workouts. My energy improved slightly by the end of the week. Sleep remained about the same - still hard to get more than 6-7 hours with my schedule."

I managed to follow the diet about 60% of the time, though I had to simplify some meals or grab something quicker on busier days. The workouts were VERY intense - I didn't realize 'advanced' meant that level! I could only complete about 50-60% of the exercises at lower weights. My legs were extremely sore after the first leg day. I'm sleeping slightly better, maybe from the exercise fatigue. I can feel some positive changes in my energy levels mid-week, and my clothes feel just a tiny bit looser. I know it's early but I'm cautiously optimistic."

I struggled with the advanced gym workouts - they were honestly too intense for my beginner fitness level. I had to modify several exercises and couldn't complete all the sets. By Wednesday my legs were so sore from the leg day that I almost skipped the next workout. I did follow the meal plan about 4 days fully, and the other 3 days I was close but had slightly larger portions at dinner because I felt very hungry after the workouts. The tahini salad snack was surprisingly satisfying. Sleep was about the same as usual, maybe slightly better on workout days because I was more tired.

The gym exercises were intimidating and I couldn't complete full sets, maybe doing 50-60% of what was prescribed. My form probably wasn't great either. I did make it to the gym all 3 days though, which I'm proud of. Sleep stayed about the same around 7 hours. I feel a bit sore and slightly less bloated.

The gym programs labeled 'Advanced' were really intimidating and I couldn't complete all the sets. I did about 60% of each workout and had to use much lighter weights than prescribed.

I'm a beginner but got assigned advanced gym routines, so I modified them significantly, doing lighter weights and fewer sets. I completed 2 out of 3 planned workout days - missed Friday because I was too sore and tired. My energy improved mid-week once I got used to the routine. Sleep stayed consistent around 7 hours.

I completed all 3 workout days but honestly felt overwhelmed and sore. I followed the meal plan about 60% of the time - some days I ate out or grabbed easier options when cooking felt too complicated. The mixed nuts snack was perfect though, very convenient. I did notice slightly better energy levels and my clothes feel a tiny bit looser around the waist."

I found myself quite hungry throughout the day and managed to stick to about 60% of the plan. The workouts labeled 'Advanced' were way too difficult for my beginner fitness level - I could only complete about half of the exercises with proper form and had to skip some entirely. I felt intimidated in the gym and wasn't sure about the equipment. My energy was low, probably from the calorie deficit being too aggressive. I did my best but had to add small snacks 3-4 days to function at work. Sleep remained okay but I felt fatigued."

The W25 upper body sessions were challenging but manageable, and the W21 lower body workouts left me with noticeable DOMS for about 48 hours each time, particularly in quads and glutes. Nothing that interfered with daily activities though.

Made a few practical substitutions: swapped labneh for Greek yogurt twice when I ran out mid-week, and simplified one harees dinner to a quicker chicken and oats bowl when I got home late on Wednesday. The kabsa meal prep suggestion from last week worked great - made a big batch on Sunday that covered three dinners.

Sleep averaged right around 7 hours, maybe slightly better mid-week. No digestive issues with the higher calorie intake, which was a concern initially. The fiber target of 25g kept things comfortable. Sodium seemed a bit high on days with kabsa and processed meats, but I didn't notice any bloating.

Weight is up slightly, which is expected on a muscle gain phase. Feeling fuller in the shoulders and noticing better pump during workouts. Strength is incrementally improving - added 2.5kg to my bench press mid-sets this week. The 60 SAR daily budget was sufficient; spent about 55-58 SAR most days with the bulk cooking approach.

Looking forward to next week. Might try to squeeze in an extra 15 minutes of mobility work on rest days since the DOMS was notable."
P21,2025-W48,15.3,29.6,74.7,2650,7.1,"Completed the full week of W25 and W21 workouts as scheduled. Started Monday with upper body hypertrophy work - felt strong on the compound lifts, though I had to substitute dumbbell press for barbell on Wednesday due to rack availability at the gym during peak hours. Tuesday's leg session brought back familiar DOMS by Thursday, but manageable with adequate stretching and foam rolling. 

Diet adherence was solid at around 78-80% as expected. Hit my protein targets consistently (averaging 165-170g daily), which I credit to my Sunday meal prep routine - grilled chicken, lean beef, and portioned rice made weekday execution much smoother. Had to eat out twice this week due to work meetings, made reasonable choices (grilled fish, extra vegetables) but sodium was likely higher those days. 

Budget of 60 SAR/day worked well - spent approximately 380-400 SAR for the week on groceries and the two restaurant meals. Bought in bulk at the hypermarket which helped stretch the budget. Energy levels remained consistent throughout the week, no afternoon crashes. Sleep averaged just over 7 hours, would like to push closer to 7.5 but work demands made that challenging.

Recovery felt good overall - the 4-day split gives adequate rest between muscle groups. Noticed better pump and muscle fullness by end of week, likely from consistent carb intake around training. Minor lower back tightness after deadlift day, but nothing that impacted subsequent workouts. Hydration could be better - need to be more conscious about water intake during the day, not just around workouts.

The intermediate workout intensity feels appropriate for my current level. Progressive overload is happening naturally - added 2.5kg to my working sets on bench press and squat this week. Looking forward to continuing this momentum into next week."
P21,2025-W49,15.2,29.9,75.3,2765,7,"Week 49 wrapped up and I'm feeling the cumulative fatigue from maintaining this pace. Started at 74.7kg and ended at 75.3kg - solid 0.6kg gain that feels mostly quality given the mirror test and strength progression. The 78% adherence held steady, which I'm proud of considering work stress ramped up mid-week.

Monday's upper body session (W25) felt strong - hit all my compound lifts with good form. Tuesday I nailed the diet but skipped the planned W21 cardio because of an unexpected late meeting. Wednesday bounced back with W25 again, though I substituted some exercises due to gym equipment being occupied. Thursday's W21 was solid but I felt the sleep debt catching up.

Diet-wise, I stayed within my 60 SAR daily budget by batch-cooking chicken and rice on Sunday. Had to swap salmon for mackerel twice (cheaper, still hit protein targets). Friday I went about 200 kcal over target at a work lunch - chicken shawarma plate was unavoidable but I adjusted dinner. Weekend meals were on point.

DOMS in quads and lats peaked Wednesday-Thursday but manageable with proper warmups. Sleep averaged 7.0 hours - slightly down from my usual 7.1 due to one rough night (6.2 hours Thursday). Energy levels were good overall, maybe 7.5/10 average.

The muscle gain is happening - shirts fitting tighter in shoulders and arms. Body fat stayed relatively stable which is exactly what I want. No injuries, no major setbacks. The intermediate cooking skills really help with meal prep efficiency.

Looking ahead, I need to prioritize that Thursday sleep and maybe prep some quick breakfast options to avoid the morning rush compromises. Overall, very satisfied with this week's progress."
P21,2025-W50,15,30.1,75.7,2698,6.9,"Week 50 completed with solid adherence despite some real-world challenges. Started strong Monday and Tuesday with full workout completion and meal prep locked in. Wednesday hit a barrier when a client dinner ran late - had to skip the evening W25 session entirely, which was frustrating but unavoidable in my line of work. Adjusted Thursday's session to compensate slightly with an extra set on major compounds. Friday's W21 workout felt particularly strong, likely benefiting from the extra recovery day. Weekend training went well, though Saturday's session was slightly shortened due to family commitments (still hit 85% of planned volume). Sleep was mostly good except Wednesday night (5.8 hours due to work stress) and Friday (6.4 hours - stayed up watching a game, my fault). Nutrition adherence stayed around 78-80% as expected. Budget worked well - continued the mackerel swap strategy which saved about 15 SAR this week while hitting protein targets. Had one unplanned restaurant meal Thursday lunch with a colleague (+250 kcal estimated), but adjusted dinner portions to compensate. DOMS from Monday's leg-focused W25 lingered until Wednesday but manageable. No injuries, form felt solid throughout. The 45-60 age bracket means I'm more mindful of recovery - listened to my body and reduced weight by 5% on deadlifts Saturday when lower back felt tight. Overall satisfied with the week despite the missed Wednesday session. Strength progression continues gradually on bench press (added 2.5kg for working sets) and noticed better mind-muscle connection on isolation work. Meal prep on Sunday evening set me up well for the week ahead. Hydration consistent at 3+ liters daily. The realistic challenge of balancing work, training, and life at this age is evident, but the 78% adherence propensity held true."
P21,2025-W51,14.8,30.3,76.1,2780,6.8,"Completed the first week of W51 with solid adherence overall. Started Monday strong with the W25 leg workout - felt the familiar DOMS kicking in by Tuesday morning, which is expected given the volume. Tuesday's W21 upper body session went well, managed all sets with good form. Wednesday was a challenge - had a late work meeting that pushed dinner back, so I grabbed a quick shawarma wrap on the way home (budget-friendly at 25 SAR but higher sodium than planned). Still hit my protein target thanks to the chicken. Thursday's W25 workout felt heavy on the lower back initially, so I warmed up extra carefully and reduced deadlift working weight by about 5% as a precaution - better safe than sorry at my age. Friday was my rest day but sleep wasn't great (6.2 hours) due to some work stress about year-end deliverables. Saturday's W21 session was solid, felt strong on bench press and actually added 2.5kg to my working sets - clear progress there. Sunday I did meal prep for the week: marinated chicken thighs, boiled eggs, and prepped rice and vegetables. Kept costs down by buying mackerel in bulk (18 SAR/kg) and using seasonal vegetables. Overall energy levels were good despite the suboptimal sleep mid-week. Hydration stayed consistent at 3L+ daily. No injuries, though I'm being mindful of that lower back tightness. The budget of 60 SAR/day worked well - I averaged around 58 SAR by shopping smart and cooking at home mostly. One observation: the higher training frequency (4 days) is demanding on recovery, especially with work stress affecting sleep quality. I'm prioritizing form and listening to my body on load adjustments."
P21,2025-W52,14.6,30.5,76.5,2793,6.7,"Week 52 completed with solid consistency despite the holiday period challenges. Started the week at 76.1kg and managed to push through all 4 planned workout sessions (W25/W21 alternating pattern). The intermediate workout intensity felt appropriate for my current fitness level, though I noticed cumulative fatigue building by Friday.

Diet adherence was strong at approximately 79% - hit my protein targets most days (averaging 172g vs 176g target), and stayed within my 60 SAR daily budget, averaging around 57.5 SAR. The 2841 kcal target proved challenging on Tuesday when work ran late and I missed my afternoon snack window, ending around 2650 kcal that day. Made up for it Wednesday with a solid 2890 kcal day including extra rice with my grilled chicken dinner.

Workouts felt productive: Monday's W25 upper body session went well with good pump on chest exercises. Tuesday's W21 lower body was tough but manageable - kept form strict on squats. Thursday repeated W25 with slightly better performance on shoulder press (+1 rep on final set). Saturday's W21 felt heavy on deadlifts, likely due to accumulated fatigue, so I dropped weight by 5kg to maintain form integrity - learning from last week's lower back tightness.

Sleep averaged 6.7 hours this week, slightly below my usual 6.8. Wednesday night was particularly rough at 6.1 hours due to year-end work deadlines. This definitely impacted Thursday's energy levels. Friday and Saturday I compensated with 7.1 and 7.2 hours respectively, which helped recovery.

Recovery protocols maintained: foam rolling 4x this week, stretching post-workout, and kept hydration above 3L daily. DOMS was moderate in quads Wednesday-Thursday but manageable. No injuries or concerning pain. The preventive approach on deadlifts Thursday was the right call.

Notable wins: Meal prep Sunday evening set me up well for the week. Prepared chicken breast, brown rice, and roasted vegetables in bulk. One unplanned restaurant meal Friday (shawarma plate) pushed sodium up by estimated 350mg but stayed reasonable overall. Body feels slightly fuller, noticing better muscle definition in shoulders and arms. Weight increased modestly which aligns with muscle gain goal.

Challenges: Holiday temptations at family gathering Saturday evening - had one extra serving of dessert (estimated +300 kcal). Morning energy on short sleep days required extra coffee. Work stress mid-week affected appetite timing.

Progression notes: Bench press working weight increased by 2.5kg as noted from last week - now at 3x8 with good control. Planning to test 1RM in 2-3 weeks. Squat depth improving with mobility work paying off. Overall strength trending upward while maintaining technique focus.

Moving into Week 1 of 2026, will maintain current programming. May add 5-10 minutes mobility work on rest days. Budget and meal prep strategy working well, no changes needed there. Priority: protect sleep hours and manage work stress better to optimize recovery."
P21,2026-W01,14.6,30.6,76.8,2735,6.5,"Week 1 of 2026 went reasonably well overall. I managed to stick to the training schedule with all 4 workouts completed (Monday W25, Tuesday W21, Thursday W25, Saturday W21), which felt good given my 78% adherence tendency. The workout intensity was appropriate for my intermediate level, though I did feel some accumulated fatigue by Saturday's session.

Diet-wise, I hit around 76% adherence this week - slightly below my usual 79% from last week. Monday and Tuesday were solid with meal prep carrying over from the weekend. Wednesday was tougher due to a work event where I ended up eating out and going over sodium by about 400mg. Thursday I compensated well, but Friday I had a client dinner that pushed me to about 2900 kcal (150 over target). Weekend was back on track except for Sunday evening when I was just too tired to prep properly and grabbed a shawarma wrap that wasn't ideal macros-wise.

Protein averaged around 168g/day - just slightly under the 172g target, but close enough. Carbs were sometimes higher than planned (especially Friday), and fat intake crept up mid-week. Fiber was consistently good at 24-26g daily.

Sleep was a challenge this week. Averaged 6.5 hours, down from my usual 6.7. Monday and Wednesday were particularly rough at 6.0-6.2 hours due to work stress and early meetings. I tried to catch up on the weekend with 7.0-7.1 hours, which helped with recovery. The sleep deficit definitely impacted my energy levels, especially noticeable during Thursday's workout.

Strength-wise, I maintained the bench press load from last week (+2.5kg from baseline) and even pushed an extra rep on the final set Monday. Deadlifts on Thursday I kept conservative due to lower back tightness - probably smart given the cumulative fatigue. Squats felt heavy on Saturday, likely the sleep debt catching up.

DOMS was moderate in quads Tuesday-Wednesday and hamstrings Friday-Saturday. Nothing concerning, just normal training response. No injuries, though I did feel some right shoulder clicking during overhead press Tuesday - kept an eye on it and it resolved by Thursday.

Budget management was good: averaged 58 SAR/day, well within my 60 SAR limit. The client dinner Friday was covered by work, so that helped. Meal prep on Sunday for the week ahead cost about 340 SAR for 5 days of lunches and dinners.

Hydration stayed consistent at 3.0-3.2L daily. Form remained a priority - I videoed my squats on Saturday and technique looked solid.

Overall, I'm seeing very subtle body composition changes. Weight is up slightly (about 0.3kg), which is expected on a muscle gain phase. Muscle mass feels marginally up, maybe 0.1kg, though it's hard to measure precisely week-to-week. Fat percentage holding steady around 14.5-14.7%.

For next week, I need to focus on: 1) Getting sleep back to 6.7+ hours consistently, 2) Tightening up diet adherence to 78-80% range, especially controlling those work dinners, 3) Monitoring shoulder during pressing movements, 4) Continuing progressive overload cautiously given I'm 45-60 age band and recovery matters more."
P21,2026-W02,14.5,30.75,77.1,2765,6.5,"Week 2 was a mixed bag. I hit all 4 planned workouts (W25 Monday/Friday, W21 Wednesday/Saturday), which felt solid given my intermediate level and 78% adherence tendency. The diet totals provided (722 kcal target per day with 25g protein) seemed way too low for muscle gain at my weight, so I interpreted this as a daily meal component or snack target and continued my established ~2750 kcal/day pattern with 170g protein goal based on last week's notes.

Monday and Wednesday workouts felt strong. Bench press progression continued smoothly, and I added 2.5kg to my working sets on W25 days. The W21 sessions (more hypertrophy-focused) generated good muscle tension, especially on leg exercises. Thursday I felt the sleep debt catching up—only averaged 6.1 hours Mon-Wed again, and my deadlift warm-up sets felt heavy, so I backed off 10% on working weight to protect my lower back.

Diet adherence landed around 74% this week, slightly down from last week's 76%. Tuesday evening I had an unplanned client dinner (shawarma plate, estimated +250 kcal over target, higher sodium ~+500mg). Sunday meal prep went well—spent 315 SAR for 5 days of lunches and dinners, staying under my 60 SAR/day budget at ~57 SAR average. I tracked protein carefully: Monday 165g, Tuesday 172g, Wednesday 158g (missed afternoon snack), Thursday 175g, Friday 169g, Saturday 180g (post-workout shake + grilled chicken), Sunday 162g. Average came to 169g, just under my 172g target but acceptable.

Sodium spiked Tuesday (that client dinner) and again Friday when I grabbed a convenience store wrap (+380mg over baseline). Hydration stayed consistent at 3.1-3.3L daily. DOMS was moderate—quads burned Tuesday-Wednesday after Monday's W25 squats, and hamstrings were tight Saturday-Sunday from Friday's Romanian deadlifts.

Shoulder felt good all week—no clicking this time. I focused on controlled eccentric phases and kept strict form on overhead movements. Videoed my Saturday squats again; depth and bar path looked clean.

Sleep improved slightly over the weekend (7.0hr Saturday, 6.9hr Sunday) but weekday average was still only 6.3 hours. I'm feeling the cumulative fatigue in my recovery. Energy dipped noticeably Thursday and Friday mornings. I need to prioritize earlier bedtimes—aiming for 7+ hours consistently.

No injuries, no missed workouts. Weight trend is stable with slight upward movement, which aligns with muscle gain goals. Strength is progressing incrementally. I'm pleased with workout consistency but frustrated with sleep and minor diet slips. The 60 SAR/day budget is manageable with meal prep discipline, though social/work dinners remain a challenge for macro control.

Overall: solid training week, adequate nutrition, but sleep remains the limiting factor for optimal recovery and gains. Need to address that next week."
P21,2026-W03,14.4,30.95,77.5,2987,6.4,"Week 3 presented a mixed bag of progress and challenges. Started strong with Monday's W25 workout hitting a new bench PR, adding another 2.5kg from last week. The momentum carried through Wednesday's W21 session where I felt explosive on power movements. However, the cumulative sleep deficit (averaging 6.4 hours this week vs my usual 6.5) started catching up by Thursday. Friday's W25 workout was solid but I could feel the fatigue in my central nervous system—grip strength was noticeably weaker on deadlifts, so I dropped the weight 5% to maintain form integrity.

Diet adherence hovered around 76% this week, slightly up from last week's 74%. Protein intake averaged 178g/day, exceeding my 172g target which felt great for recovery. The challenge came Tuesday evening when a colleague's birthday at work meant unexpected baklava (roughly 320 extra kcal, 18g fat). I adjusted dinner portions to compensate but still ended the day about 180 kcal over target. Thursday I intentionally reduced carbs by 40g pre-workout due to feeling sluggish—this backfired as my squat performance suffered.

Saturday's W21 workout was surprisingly strong despite accumulated fatigue. I attribute this to sleeping 7.2 hours Friday night and a well-timed pre-workout meal. DOMS hit hard Sunday in glutes and hamstrings, making meal prep more tedious than usual. Sodium management improved—only one spike on Tuesday (baklava day, +420mg over target). Hydration remained consistent at 3.2-3.4L daily.

Budget came in at 58.2 SAR/day average. Sunday meal prep cost 328 SAR for 5.5 days of lunches and dinners. I splurged 15 SAR on premium Greek yogurt for post-workout meals which proved worthwhile for protein goals. The persistent 6.5-hour sleep pattern is definitely my limiting factor—I can feel it in recovery time and afternoon energy levels. Next week I'm targeting 7 hours minimum on workout nights.

Body composition changes are subtle but trending positively. Weight up 0.4kg over the week, which at my caloric surplus is appropriate. Visual assessment shows slightly fuller shoulders and upper chest. Strength gains continue on upper body (bench, overhead press) while lower body is maintaining due to fatigue management. No injuries or pain, though right hip flexor felt tight Thursday—added extra stretching post-workout.

Overall, solid week with clear areas for improvement: prioritize sleep on workout nights, plan better for social food events, and possibly shift to 3 workouts per week if cumulative fatigue continues building. The muscle gain goal is progressing, but sustainability requires addressing the sleep deficit."
P21,2026-W04,14.3,31.05,77.8,2738,6.4,"Week 4 was a mixed bag. Started strong with good workout intensity on Monday and Wednesday, hitting W25 and W21 protocols as planned. The 4-day split felt manageable, but sleep continues to be my Achilles heel—averaging 6.4 hours again with weekdays particularly brutal at around 6.1 hours. This affected my Friday W25 session where I had to drop the bench press weight by 2.5kg from Monday due to CNS fatigue and shoulder tightness.

Diet adherence was solid at 74%, slightly below my propensity but understandable given the work week pressures. I managed to keep protein high at 176g/day average, just 2g above target, which felt good for recovery. Tuesday was another slip-up day—colleague brought kunafa to the office and I couldn't resist. That added about 340 kcal and spiked my sodium by roughly 380mg. I felt bloated Wednesday morning but pushed through the workout.

Budget management was excellent this week at 57.8 SAR/day average. Sunday meal prep cost 315 SAR for 6 days of lunches and some dinners, which kept me on track. I've gotten better at bulk buying chicken breast and using lentils as a protein extender.

The Saturday W21 session was tough—legs were still recovering from Thursday's squats, and I experienced moderate DOMS in quads and glutes. Had to reduce deadlift volume by about 10% to avoid overtraining. Right hip flexor acted up again on Thursday during squats, same spot as last week. I'm wondering if my hip mobility work is insufficient or if the 4-day frequency is too much for my recovery capacity at 6.4 hours sleep.

Positives: No injuries, hydration stayed consistent at 3.3L daily, and I'm seeing slight definition improvements in my shoulders and upper chest. The mirror test shows I'm leaning out a bit while maintaining size. Negatives: Sleep deficit is cumulative and I can feel it in my afternoon energy crashes around 3 PM. I've been relying on black coffee to push through, which might be affecting my sleep quality in a vicious cycle.

Strength-wise, I'm plateauing on bench press (stuck at same weight as Monday to Friday), but squat improved by 2.5kg from last week's Thursday session. Deadlifts feel strong but I'm being conservative due to lower back tightness that appears when sleep is poor.

Overall, I'd rate this week 7/10. Solid execution on workouts and diet, but the sleep issue is becoming a real limiting factor for progression. I need to prioritize getting to bed 30 minutes earlier, especially on weekdays."
P21,2026-W05,14.2,31.15,78.1,2947,6.4,"Week 5 of 2026 complete. Started Monday strong with W25 upper body session - bench press felt better than last Friday, managed to hold the weight steady at 82.5kg for working sets. Tuesday was a bit rough with afternoon energy crash around 3 PM, definitely feeling that cumulative sleep debt. Grabbed an extra coffee which helped push through the day but affected Tuesday night sleep (only 5.8 hours). Wednesday's W21 lower body went well, squat progression continuing at 105kg for 4x6, though right hip flexor needed extra attention during warm-up. 

Thursday was a rest day but meal prep took longer than expected - spent about 2.5 hours prepping chicken, rice, and vegetables for the next few days. Budget came in at 62 SAR which is slightly over but needed quality protein sources. Friday's W25 session showed some fatigue - reduced bench slightly to 80kg to focus on form and avoid injury. CNS fatigue is real at this age and with the sleep deficit. Saturday's W21 deadlift day was solid, pulled 125kg for 3x5 but kept volume conservative given lower back tightness from Wednesday.

Diet adherence was around 76% this week - hit protein targets most days (averaging 182g) but had a small slip-up Thursday evening with some dates and Arabic coffee at a family gathering, added about 280 extra calories. Sodium management was better this week, stayed under 2400mg daily except Saturday (2580mg from eating out at lunch). Sleep averaged 6.4 hours again - really need to prioritize getting to bed earlier, the weekday average of 6.1 hours is catching up with me.

Positive notes: shoulder definition continues to improve, chest feels fuller. Squat progression is consistent. Hip flexor issue is manageable with proper warm-up. Hydration stayed good at 3.4L daily average. Recovery between sessions felt adequate despite sleep issues.

Challenges: Sleep remains the biggest barrier. Afternoon energy crashes are predictable now. Bench press plateau persists - might need to adjust programming or add accessory work. Weekend sleep helps but doesn't fully compensate for weekday deficit. Budget management is tight but doable with meal prep discipline.

Overall feeling: Solid week with 4/4 workouts completed. Body is responding well to the program despite age and sleep constraints. Need to be strategic about recovery and potentially add an extra rest day if fatigue accumulates further. The muscle gain goal is progressing slowly but steadily - realistic for my age bracket and current deficit management."
P21,2026-W06,14.1,31.25,78.4,2890,6.3,"Week 6 of 2026 proved challenging but productive overall. Started Monday strong with W25 workout hitting bench press at 82.5kg for prescribed reps, though right shoulder felt slightly fatigued from previous week's volume. Diet adherence hovered around 74% this week - slightly below my typical 78% propensity due to two unplanned social events (Wednesday dinner with colleagues, Saturday family lunch). Sleep remained suboptimal at 6.3 hours average, with Tuesday and Thursday particularly rough at 5.8 hours each, leading to noticeable afternoon energy crashes around 2-3 PM. Had to rely on extra coffee those days which pushed my caffeine intake higher than ideal.

Protein targets were mostly met, averaging 179g daily, though Saturday I fell short at 162g due to the restaurant meal being carb-heavy. Managed meal prep on Sunday within budget (58 SAR), but Wednesday's unplanned dinner cost 45 SAR, putting me over weekly food budget by approximately 23 SAR. The financial stress was minor but noticeable.

Workouts felt solid Monday and Wednesday (W25 and W21 respectively), with squat progression to 107.5kg on Wednesday feeling strong despite hip flexor tightness requiring 15-minute warm-up. Friday's W25 session showed CNS fatigue - reduced bench to 80kg as planned for deload, but even that felt heavier than expected. Saturday's W21 deadlift session at 127.5kg went well technically, though lower back tightness appeared post-workout, requiring 20 minutes of stretching and foam rolling.

DOMS was moderate throughout, particularly glutes and hamstrings Thursday through Saturday. Hydration stayed consistent at 3.2-3.5L daily. Noticed continued visual improvements in shoulder and chest definition when checking mirror on Sunday morning. No injuries occurred, though I'm monitoring the recurring right hip flexor tightness and lower back response to deadlifts. The 6.4-hour sleep pattern is definitely impacting recovery - I can feel the accumulated fatigue by week's end. Need to prioritize earlier bedtime next week, aiming for 7+ hours at least 4 nights."
P21,2026-W07,14,31.35,78.7,2987,6.2,"Week 7 was challenging but productive overall. I managed to complete all 4 scheduled workouts (W25 Monday/Friday, W21 Wednesday/Saturday), which felt like a solid achievement given my ongoing sleep debt. My adherence was around 76%, slightly below my usual propensity but understandable given two social eating situations.

The good: Strength progression continues steadily. Monday's bench press at 82.5kg felt controlled for 4x6, and I pushed squat to 110kg on Wednesday with good depth. Deadlifts Saturday at 130kg for 3x5 were tough but form held. I'm seeing continued visual improvements in shoulder and chest definition, which is motivating.

The challenges: Sleep remains my biggest barrier at 6.2 hours average. Tuesday and Thursday afternoons were brutal - I hit energy crashes around 2-3 PM despite extra coffee. This affected my meal timing and I ended up grabbing a quick shawarma Tuesday evening (unplanned +280 kcal) because I was too tired to cook my prepped meal. Friday's workout showed clear CNS fatigue; I had to drop bench to 80kg as planned but it felt harder than it should have.

Social situations: Thursday evening family gathering meant I went over budget by about 35 SAR for the week. The meal was higher in carbs and sodium (~2640mg that day) but I managed to get decent protein (171g). Sunday lunch with extended family was similar - harder to control portions and macros, ended up around 168g protein that day.

Recovery and body feedback: Right hip flexor tightness persisted Wednesday and Friday, requiring 15-minute warm-ups before squats and deadlifts. Lower back felt tight after Saturday's deadlifts but 20 minutes of foam rolling and stretching sorted it out. DOMS in glutes and hamstrings Thursday through Sunday was moderate but manageable. No new injuries, which I'm grateful for at 45+.

Nutrition: Protein averaged 177g/day, slightly below my 183g target but close enough given the circumstances. Meal prep Sunday cost 62 SAR, and with the unplanned meals I ended up about 28 SAR over my weekly budget (420 SAR). Hydration stayed consistent at 3.2-3.4L daily.

Looking ahead: I need to prioritize sleep more aggressively. The 6.2-hour average is clearly impacting recovery and energy levels. I'm considering shifting my bedtime 30 minutes earlier, even if it means less evening screen time. The strength gains are there, but I'm leaving progress on the table by not recovering properly. Overall, I'm satisfied with the workout completion and the direction I'm heading, but sleep and budget discipline need attention."
P21,2026-W08,13.9,31.5,79.1,3095,6.1,"Week 08 was a grind. The accumulated sleep debt from last week carried over hard, and I could feel it in every training session. Started Monday strong with W25, hit bench press at 82.5kg for 4x6 again—felt solid, no regression there. Wednesday's W21 session was tougher than expected; squat at 112.5kg (attempted progression) but only managed 4x5 instead of 4x6. Right hip flexor was screaming during warm-ups, needed 20 minutes of mobility work before I felt safe to load the bar.

Friday's W25 session was where things got dicey. Planned to push bench to 85kg but my CNS was fried—stuck with 82.5kg and even that felt heavy. Shoulder fatigue was real. Saturday's W21 deadlift day, I pulled 132.5kg for 3x5, which is progression, but form started breaking down on the last set. Lower back tightness was immediate, spent 25 minutes post-workout on foam rolling and stretching.

Diet adherence took a hit this week—came in around 74%, below my propensity. Tuesday I was so exhausted I grabbed fast food after work (chicken nuggets meal, ~420 kcal over target). Thursday was another family gathering, and I just couldn't say no to the kabsa and dessert (+385 kcal). Sunday family lunch was manageable but still went over by about 240 kcal. Protein averaged around 181g/day, which is decent but not optimal for the training volume.

Sleep was brutal—averaged 6.1 hours, with weekdays hovering around 5.7 hours. I tried to catch up on the weekend (7.2 and 7.5 hours) but it wasn't enough. Energy crashes hit me Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday afternoons. Coffee consumption was through the roof—4-5 cups on those days just to function.

Budget-wise, I'm in trouble. Meal prep cost me 68 SAR on Sunday, but the unplanned meals (Tuesday fast food, Thursday gathering contributions, Sunday lunch) added another ~112 SAR. That puts me about 60 SAR over my weekly budget of 420 SAR. I need to get this under control.

Physically, I'm seeing continued definition in shoulders and upper chest, which is encouraging. Weight is up slightly, which tracks with the muscle gain goal. But the DOMS from Wednesday's squats lasted until Sunday—glutes and hamstrings were wrecked. Hip flexor tightness is becoming a pattern; I need to add dedicated hip mobility work daily, not just pre-workout.

Recovery is my biggest enemy right now. The strength gains are there (progressive overload maintained on most lifts), but I'm paying for it with fatigue and compromised form. If I don't fix the sleep situation, I'm going to stall or worse, get injured. The lower back tightness after deadlifts is a warning sign. I'm holding the line on progression, but barely. Need to prioritize sleep this coming week—maybe skip one social obligation to get an extra night of 7+ hours."
P21,2026-W09,13.8,31.7,79.4,3045,6.1,"Week 09 complete. Another challenging week balancing training intensity with recovery limitations. Sleep debt continues to be my biggest barrier - averaging just 6.1 hours again despite knowing I need more. The CNS fatigue from last week carried over into Monday's session, and I could feel it throughout the week.

Diet adherence came in around 76%, slightly better than Week 08 but still below my usual propensity. The budget situation improved - I stayed closer to target this week at about 440 SAR total (20 SAR over), mainly because I learned from last week's overspending and did better meal prep planning. Wednesday's work lunch still cost me 45 SAR and added unwanted calories, and Saturday's family gathering was another unplanned 380+ kcal spike, but I managed to navigate these better than previous weeks.

Training went 4/4 sessions completed again. Monday's W25 felt heavy - that 82.5kg bench is really testing my limits at 4x6, and I only managed 6/6/5/4 reps. The hip flexor tightness required 20 minutes of warm-up work. Wednesday's W21 squat session at 112.5kg was brutal - my legs are still feeling last week's DOMS, and I had to drop to 4x4 instead of 4x5. Friday's W25 was better after an extra rest day, managed 6/6/6/5 on bench. Saturday's W21 deadlift at 132.5kg went 5/5/4 - form breakdown on that third set again, and my lower back is telling me about it.

The hip flexor issue is persistent now, present in 3 of 4 sessions. I'm spending 15-25 minutes on mobility work before lifting, which cuts into my actual training time but is necessary. The lower back tightness post-deadlift is concerning - I need to really focus on form or potentially deload next week.

Energy crashes hit hard Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday afternoons around 2-3 PM. I'm relying on 4-5 cups of coffee on those days, which probably isn't helping my sleep. It's a vicious cycle: poor sleep leads to fatigue, which leads to more caffeine, which disrupts sleep further.

Protein intake averaged 183g/day, which is solid. Hydration stayed consistent at 3.2-3.4L daily. The visual progress continues - chest and shoulders are noticeably more defined, and my wife commented on my arms looking bigger. Weight is up slightly to 79.4kg, which tracks with the muscle gain goal.

The DOMS situation improved compared to last week - only moderate glute/hamstring soreness Wednesday through Friday instead of severe all week. Recovery is still compromised by the sleep debt though. I can feel my body is adapting to the training volume, but I'm walking a fine line between progression and overtraining.

For Week 10, I need to: 1) Prioritize sleep - aim for 7+ hours at least 3 nights, 2) Consider a deload on deadlifts to fix form issues, 3) Continue the hip flexor mobility work, 4) Reduce afternoon caffeine to improve sleep quality, 5) Keep meal prep consistent to stay on budget. The strength gains are there, but I'm paying for them with recovery debt. Need to find better balance."

The foul medames breakfast was filling and kept me energized through morning meetings. I did swap the hummus snack for protein shakes twice when I was rushing between appointments. The chicken kabsa became my favorite meal - reminded me of home cooking. Training sessions went well - completed all 4 workouts as planned. The advanced upper body routine was challenging but manageable at my level. Legs day left me properly sore for two days. I noticed better pumps during workouts, likely from the increased calories. Sleep remained around 6 hours most nights due to work stress, though I did get 7 hours twice. Energy levels improved noticeably by day 4-5. Some bloating initially from the carb increase but that settled. Ready to continue into week 2."

I did struggle a bit with the calorie target on two days where I had business lunches and couldn't fully control portions. Sleep remained challenging with work stress, averaging around 6.5 hours. Noticed slight strength improvements on bench press and squats. Energy levels were good throughout the week, especially on training days.

I hit the gym 4 times as planned, alternating between the upper body and leg workouts. The advanced routines were challenging but appropriate for my intermediate fitness level. I noticed good energy levels during workouts, especially after the Ful Medames breakfast. The protein intake from chicken and fish meals supported recovery well. Sleep remained consistent around 6.5 hours due to work commitments. I occasionally reduced portions slightly when feeling full, particularly at dinner, which brought my actual calorie intake to about 2550 kcal daily instead of the target 2734. Overall feeling stronger and more pumped, especially in upper body. Minor soreness in legs after the advanced leg days but nothing concerning."

At 696 kcal for the first meal and around 2484 kcal total daily, I was constantly hungry and low on energy, especially with the advanced gym workouts. I stuck to the plan about 78% of the time, but on two days I added extra protein shakes and nuts because I felt depleted after the intense upper body and leg sessions. The Shakshuka breakfast was delicious and filling, and I really enjoyed the Grilled Chicken Kebabs with Tabbouleh - that's going into my regular rotation. The Mujadara was hearty but I found myself needing more food post-workout. Sleep remained challenging at my usual 6.5 hours due to work stress. I did notice some strength improvements in the gym, particularly on the leg day, but recovery felt slower than ideal. For muscle gain at my age and activity level, I think I need more calories and protein. The workouts themselves were excellent - challenging but appropriate for my intermediate-to-advanced level."

The high protein intake (200g) was manageable with the meat-heavy Saudi dishes. Could feel slight strength improvements on bench press and squats by end of week."
P21,2026-W40,11.2,37.9,96.1,2640,6.4,"Solid first week on the plan. I managed to stick to the meal prep about 75-80% of the time, which felt realistic given my work schedule. The shakshuka breakfast was excellent and easy to make. I particularly enjoyed the kabsah - reminded me of home cooking. Had to eat out twice this week, so I approximated the macros as best I could. The workouts were challenging but appropriate for my level. The advanced upper body session really pushed me, especially on the compound movements. Legs day left me properly sore for two days. I did miss one workout day due to a late work meeting. Sleep remained around my usual 6-7 hours - tried to get more but work stress kept me up a couple nights. Energy levels were good throughout the week, and I noticed better pump during workouts. The 2750 calories felt like a good surplus without being uncomfortably full. I'm seeing slight improvements in the mirror, particularly in shoulder and chest fullness. Recovery between sessions was manageable with the intermediate rest periods."

Had to substitute lamb chops twice with chicken due to availability, but kept the macros similar. The Kabsa was excellent and I meal-prepped it for three days which helped with adherence. Workouts felt challenging but good - the advanced upper body session really pushed me, especially on day 3 when I was a bit fatigued. Legs day was brutal but completed all sets. Missed one workout day due to a work commitment running late. Sleep remained consistent around my usual 6-7 hours, though I tried to get closer to 7 on workout days. Noticed better pump during training and feeling slightly fuller in the chest and shoulders. Energy levels were good throughout the week, no major hunger issues. The dates and yogurt snack became my favorite - great post-workout. Could feel a bit bloated on higher carb days but nothing concerning."

Had to skip one workout day due to work commitments, so completed 3 out of 4 planned sessions. The advanced upper body and legs workouts were challenging but felt good. I noticed some strength gains on bench press and squats. Energy levels were decent, though I could use more sleep. The calorie target felt appropriate - never too hungry but also not overly stuffed. The quinoa and chicken combo for lunch worked well for meal prep. Struggled a bit with hitting the exact protein target on two days when eating out for business, probably got closer to 160g those days. Overall weight is up slightly which aligns with the muscle gain goal, and I can see a bit more fullness in my shoulders and quads."

Workouts felt intense - the advanced upper body session really pushed me, especially on the compound movements. Legs day left me sore for 3 days. I did all 4 planned sessions this week. Energy levels were good during training, though I felt a bit sluggish mid-afternoon on two days when I didn't time my meals well.

I managed to stick to the meal plan about 75-80% of the time - the Shakshuka breakfast became my favorite and the Chicken Kabsa was excellent. Had to skip one workout day due to work commitments, so only hit 3 sessions instead of 4. The advanced upper body workout was challenging but felt good, really pushed myself on the compound movements. Legs day left me sore for two days which affected my sleep a bit mid-week. The calorie target felt appropriate - I was satisfied but not overly full. Noticed I'm already feeling slightly fuller in my shoulders and chest. The cooking was manageable with my intermediate skills, though the stuffed grape leaves took longer than expected the first time. Weekend adherence was harder with family gatherings, probably hit only 60% of macros on Saturday."

The gym sessions were intense - the advanced upper body workout really pushed me, especially the compound movements. Legs day left me sore for two days. I noticed I'm sleeping slightly better, maybe due to the increased training volume. Energy levels were good throughout the week, though I felt a bit heavy after the larger meals. The 2750 kcal target felt appropriate for my training days, but on rest days it seemed like a lot. I did have one unplanned meal out with colleagues on Thursday where I went over my targets. The chicken shawarma wraps were convenient for post-workout meals. I'm feeling stronger in the gym and my lifts are progressing nicely."

The shakshuka breakfast was excellent and easy to prep ahead. I did swap the hummus snack for protein bars twice when I was traveling for work. The lamb kebabs were fantastic - definitely a highlight. I hit all 4 workout sessions this week (2x upper body, 2x legs) and felt strong, especially on the compound lifts. The advanced programming was challenging but manageable at my current level. Recovery was decent though I'm still only averaging around 6.5 hours of sleep due to early morning meetings. I noticed better energy during workouts and slight improvements in the mirror, particularly upper body pump. Weight is up slightly which is expected on a muscle gain phase. Planning to continue with better meal prep this coming week to hit closer to 85% adherence."
P21,2026-W47,10.2,39.35,100.1,2680,6.7,"First week on the plan went reasonably well. I managed to stick to the meal plan about 75-80% of the time - the Foul Medames breakfast became a favorite and the Bukhari Rice dinners were excellent. Had to skip one workout day due to work commitments, so completed 3 out of 4 planned sessions. The advanced upper body and legs workouts were challenging but manageable given my intermediate fitness level. I did feel hungry between meals on a couple of days and added an extra snack (handful of nuts) twice. Sleep remained around my usual 6-7 hours - tried to improve it but work stress made that difficult. Energy levels were good during workouts, and I'm noticing slightly better pump and recovery. The 60 SAR daily budget was sufficient for the quality ingredients. Looking forward to continuing, though I need to be more consistent with that 4th workout day."

The Chicken Kabsa became a favorite - reminded me of home cooking. I did struggle a bit with the salmon meal twice this week due to work running late, so I substituted with grilled chicken instead. The yogurt and nuts snack was perfect post-workout. Training sessions went well - the upper body workouts were challenging but manageable at my level. Legs day left me properly sore for two days. I noticed good pumps during workouts and recovery seemed adequate. Sleep remained around my usual 6.5-7 hours, though I tried to push for more on workout days.

P22,2025-W46,25.3,20.15,60.2,1750,7.4,"This week was challenging but rewarding. The ful medames breakfast became my favorite - so filling and energizing! I managed to stick to the meal plan about 5 days out of 7, though I had to swap the jareesh for grilled fish twice because I couldn't find the right grains at my local market. The advanced workouts were intense - I'm at intermediate level so the leg days really pushed me. I had to reduce weights on some exercises but completed all sessions. My energy levels were good throughout the week, and I noticed my clothes fitting slightly better around my waist. The labneh snack was perfect post-workout. I did struggle with sodium intake on days when I added extra salt to meals out of habit."
P22,2025-W47,24.9,20.35,60,2095,7.3,"This week was challenging but rewarding. I managed to complete all 4 planned workouts (W25 and W21 alternating), though I had to modify some exercises on the second W25 day due to residual soreness from the previous leg session. My adherence to the meal plan was around 70% - I followed the protein targets consistently but struggled with the carb portions on two days when work ran late and I grabbed quicker options. The jareesh was time-consuming to prepare, so I substituted with grilled chicken and quinoa twice. My budget of 50 SAR per day was mostly sufficient, though I went slightly over (about 55 SAR) on days when I bought pre-prepped vegetables to save time. Sleep averaged around 7.5 hours, with one particularly rough night (5.5 hours) on Wednesday due to a work deadline, which definitely impacted my Thursday workout intensity. I felt strong during upper body sessions and noticed better mind-muscle connection, but leg days left me quite fatigued for 24-48 hours afterward. I'm learning to manage recovery better with proper hydration and lighter activity on rest days. The recomposition goal feels achievable - I can see slight definition improvements in my arms and shoulders, though scale weight hasn't changed much. Planning to continue with better meal prep strategies for next week."
P22,2025-W48,24.4,20.55,59.7,2045,7.1,"Completed Week 48 with mixed results but overall pleased with my commitment. Started strong on Monday with W25 (full body strength) - felt energized and hit all my compound movements with good form. Tuesday's nutrition was spot-on at about 2,050 kcal, though I had to swap quinoa for brown rice due to store availability. Wednesday brought W21 (upper body focus) but I woke up with only 6 hours of sleep after a restless night, which definitely impacted my bench press performance - dropped weight by 10% to maintain form.

Mid-week was challenging budget-wise. Thursday I grabbed a pre-made protein bowl (35 SAR) when meal prep ran out, pushing me over budget. Friday's W25 session was excellent though - noticed I'm getting stronger on deadlifts, added 5kg from last month. Saturday's W21 workout required modification on shoulder press due to lingering fatigue from Friday, but I compensated with higher rep ranges on accessory work.

Nutrition adherence hovered around 70% as noted - I hit protein targets consistently (averaging 128g daily) but carbs were sometimes lower when I skipped evening snacks due to late work meetings. Sunday was a full rest day which I desperately needed. My body is responding well to the recomposition protocol - clothes fitting differently around shoulders and waist. One concerning note: sodium intake crept up to about 2,100mg on two days when I relied on convenience foods.

Recovery practices improving: drinking 2.5L water daily now, using foam roller consistently post-workout. The visible muscle definition changes are motivating, especially in arms and upper back. Sleep averaged 7.1 hours this week (one poor night dragged it down). Budget exceeded by approximately 25 SAR total for the week. Moving forward, I need better meal prep discipline to avoid convenience purchases and will focus on getting to bed 30 minutes earlier on workout nights."
P22,2025-W49,24,20.7,59.5,1985,7,"Completed the full week following the 2028 kcal plan with W25/W21 workout rotation. Overall adherence was solid at around 68-72%, which feels realistic for my lifestyle. I managed all 4 scheduled workouts, though Thursday's second W21 session was tough due to accumulated fatigue from the week. Modified the last few sets of leg press to lighter weight to avoid overtraining.

Meal prep on Sunday helped tremendously - having proteins portioned out meant I hit my 127g protein target most days. Tuesday and Friday I grabbed a pre-made salad from a café due to time constraints, which pushed me about 30 SAR over budget for the week. Not terrible, but I need to prep backup meals for those chaotic days.

Sleep averaged around 7 hours, with one rough night on Wednesday (only 6.5 hours) after staying up late dealing with family matters. Definitely felt it during Thursday's workout - my deadlift form wasn't as crisp, and I had to really focus on breathing and pacing.

Strength-wise, I'm pleased. Added 2.5kg to my deadlift on the second W25 session, and my shoulder press feels more stable. The recomposition goal is showing subtle progress - clothes fitting slightly better around the waist while arms look more defined. Scale barely moved, which is expected for recomp.

Sodium was higher than ideal on Saturday and Sunday - restaurant meal on Saturday and some processed convenience foods crept in. Felt a bit bloated Sunday morning. Need to watch that.

Recovery practices were good: foam rolled 5 out of 7 days, stayed hydrated (2.5-3L daily), and took my magnesium supplement before bed most nights. The extra recovery attention helped manage the 4-workout week without major soreness.

Challenges: Wednesday's poor sleep created a domino effect. Energy management between work, workouts, and meal prep is the ongoing puzzle. The 50 SAR daily budget is tight when life throws curveballs, but mostly manageable with planning.

Wins: Consistency with workouts, protein targets met 6/7 days, progressive overload maintained, and I'm learning to modify exercises when needed rather than pushing into injury territory. At 45-60 age range, listening to my body is crucial.

Next week: Pre-prep two extra emergency meals, aim for 7.5 hours sleep minimum, and reduce sodium by avoiding packaged foods on busy days."
P22,2025-W50,23.7,20.9,59.3,2038,7,"This week felt like a solid continuation of my recomposition journey, though I definitely encountered some real-world challenges. I managed to complete all 4 scheduled workouts (W25, W21, W25, W21), which I'm proud of given my 72% adherence propensity and the demands of my week. 

Monday's W25 session started strong—I felt recovered from last week and pushed through the compound movements with good form. Tuesday's W21 workout was more metabolically demanding, and I could feel my heart rate elevated throughout. By Wednesday, I hit a rough patch with sleep—only managed about 6.5 hours due to work stress and some family obligations. This definitely impacted Thursday's second W25 session; my deadlift felt heavier than it should have, and I had to take longer rest periods between sets.

Nutrition-wise, I hit about 73% adherence this week, which is slightly above my typical propensity. I met my protein targets on 5 out of 7 days—missing Monday when I had to skip my afternoon snack due to back-to-back meetings, and Saturday when I underestimated portions at a family gathering. The 2064 kcal target felt appropriate for my energy levels, though I noticed I was hungrier on workout days, especially after the W25 sessions.

Budget was a challenge again. I stayed closer to my 50 SAR/day limit this week, going over by only about 15 SAR total. I had to grab one convenience meal on Wednesday (a grilled chicken bowl from a local spot for 35 SAR) when I didn't have time to meal prep, and I picked up some emergency protein bars on Friday that weren't in my original budget. I'm learning that I need to build in a small buffer for these realistic situations.

The Friday W21 session was tough—I could feel the cumulative fatigue from the week. I modified a few exercises: swapped jump squats for regular tempo squats and reduced the plyometric intensity on some movements. My intermediate fitness level meant I knew when to adjust rather than push into potential injury territory.

Recovery practices were good: foam rolled 6 out of 7 days (missed Sunday when I was traveling), maintained hydration at about 2.8L daily, and kept up with my magnesium supplementation. Sleep averaged right around 7 hours for the week, which is my baseline.

Sodium was better controlled this week—only went over on Saturday at the family gathering where I couldn't fully control the cooking. I've been more mindful about seasoning my meal prep.

Body composition changes are subtle but encouraging. The scale barely moved (down 0.2kg), but I'm noticing continued improvements in how my clothes fit, especially around my midsection and shoulders. My lifting numbers are incrementally improving—added another 2.5kg to my working deadlift sets, and my shoulder press feels much more stable. At 45-60 years old, I'm learning to appreciate these steady, sustainable changes rather than expecting dramatic transformations.

The recomposition process requires patience, and this week reinforced that. I'm building muscle while managing body fat, and the mirror and measurements tell a better story than the scale. My intermediate cooking skills are serving me well—I batch-cooked a turkey and vegetable stir-fry, prepared overnight oats variations, and grilled chicken breasts that lasted most of the week.

Looking ahead, I need to prioritize sleep more consistently and perhaps prep one or two 'emergency meals' that I can grab quickly to avoid budget overruns. Overall, this feels sustainable, which is exactly what I need for long-term success."
P22,2025-W51,23.5,21,59.1,2089,6.9,"Week 2025-W51 completed with mixed results. Started strong Monday with W25 workout hitting all prescribed sets, though deadlifts felt heavier than last week—likely residual fatigue from W50. Meal prep went well Sunday evening with turkey meatballs and quinoa batches, which kept me on track Monday-Tuesday. Wednesday's W21 session was solid, plyometrics felt controlled and I appreciated the active recovery focus.

Mid-week challenges hit Thursday: work deadline stress disrupted my usual meal timing, ended up eating lunch at 3pm and dinner got pushed to 9pm. Sleep suffered (6.3 hours) which made Friday's W25 workout notably harder. Had to reduce deadlift working weight by 5kg and took extended rest between sets. Considered skipping but pushed through with modifications—proud of that decision even if performance wasn't peak.

Budget pressure mounted by weekend. Had to purchase pre-cooked rotisserie chicken Saturday (28 SAR) when I ran out of prepped protein, plus grabbed protein yogurt cups (18 SAR) instead of making my own. Total overage approximately 22 SAR for the week. Sunday's W21 workout felt better with improved sleep Saturday night (7.8 hours), though my glutes were still sore from Friday's modified tempo work.

Protein targets met 6/7 days—Thursday was the miss at only ~105g due to meal timing chaos. Carb intake felt appropriate for energy levels on workout days. Noticed continued strength in shoulder press stability and hip hinge patterns improving. Scale barely moved but pants fit better in waist, and I can see more definition in my shoulders when looking in mirror.

Recovery practices: foam rolled 5/7 days (missed Thursday and Saturday), maintained magnesium supplementation, averaged 2.6L water daily (slightly below target). One evening of elevated sodium Friday when I added extra salt to bland quinoa batch.

The 45-60 age band reality check: recovery takes longer than it used to. That Thursday sleep deficit had a 48-hour impact. Learning to be more protective of sleep schedule as non-negotiable. Overall adherence around 70% this week—right in my typical range but I know the budget and stress factors pulled it down from potential 75-80%."
P22,2025-W52,23.3,21.1,59,2134,6.6,"Week 52 was a mixed bag navigating holiday stress and family obligations. Started strong Monday and Tuesday with full adherence to both diet and workouts W25/W21, feeling energized despite the 6.9-hour sleep average. Wednesday hit a wall—work deadline combined with holiday shopping meant I grabbed a shawarma wrap (85 SAR total that day, way over budget) and skipped my planned W25 session entirely. Felt guilty but reminded myself one day doesn't derail progress. Thursday I rallied, completed W21 with good form, though my working weights felt heavier than usual. Sleep dipped to 6.2 hours Wednesday night which definitely impacted Thursday's energy. Friday's W25 session required modifications again—reduced deadlift load by 10% and focused on tempo work instead. My lower back was talking to me, likely from the combination of fatigue and sitting at my desk too long. Saturday was a rest day that I desperately needed. Did foam rolling for 20 minutes and meal prepped chicken breast, brown rice, and roasted vegetables for the week ahead. Sunday I felt recharged and nailed my final W21 workout of the week with shoulder press progression maintained at 18kg dumbbells. Nutrition adherence hovered around 68% this week—hit protein targets 5 out of 7 days but carbs ran high on Wednesday (that shawarma) and Friday (holiday gathering with family, couldn't resist the kabsa). Budget was blown by 47 SAR due to convenience purchases and one restaurant meal. The scale barely moved but my jeans fit better around the waist and I'm noticing more definition in my shoulders. At 45+ I'm learning to measure progress beyond the number on the scale. Recovery practices were inconsistent—only 4 days of foam rolling instead of my usual 5-6. Need to prioritize sleep better next week as the 6.5-hour average is catching up with me. Overall, maintained strength, stayed mostly on track despite holiday chaos, and feeling cautiously optimistic about body recomposition continuing."
P22,2026-W01,23,21.3,58.7,2035,6.5,"Week 1 of 2026 started with good intentions, but reality quickly set in. Monday's workout felt strong—I hit W25 with full energy and even managed to push the deadlifts without reduction this time. Nutrition was on point; I prepped a big batch of herb-marinated chicken Sunday night which saved me throughout the week. Tuesday I skipped the gym (not scheduled anyway) and focused on meal prep for the next few days. Wednesday's W21 session was solid, though I felt the sleep deficit creeping in—only got 6.3 hours due to some late-night work emails I couldn't ignore.

Thursday was my rest day, but I noticed my energy dipping hard by afternoon. I ended up grabbing a shawarma for dinner (42 SAR—ouch, over budget again) because I just didn't have it in me to cook. Friday's W25 workout happened, but I had to dial back the shoulder press to 17kg instead of 18kg. My shoulders felt fatigued, probably from the sleep debt accumulating. I did get in some extra stretching and foam rolling afterward, which helped.

Saturday's W21 was my best session of the week—I slept 7.2 hours Friday night and felt like a new person. Hit all my lifts with good form and even added an extra set of Bulgarian split squats. Nutrition-wise, I stayed under budget Saturday and Sunday by cooking at home: roasted vegetables, grilled chicken, and a big pot of lentil soup that'll carry into next week.

The scale barely moved (down 0.3kg), but I'm noticing my jeans fit better around the waist, and there's definitely more definition in my arms and shoulders. I took progress photos Sunday morning and compared them to last month—visible difference in my upper body. The recomposition is working, even if the scale doesn't show it dramatically.

Challenges this week: sleep was inconsistent (average 6.5 hours), and I went over budget by 35 SAR due to that Thursday shawarma and some emergency grocery runs (forgot eggs twice). I hit my protein target 5 out of 7 days, which I'm proud of. The two days I missed were Thursday (shawarma day, too many carbs/fat) and Sunday (family brunch with pastries—couldn't resist).

Overall adherence: 4/4 scheduled workouts completed (100%!), though Friday was modified. Nutrition adherence around 71%. I need to prioritize sleep more consistently—that 6.3-6.5 hour range is really impacting my recovery and mid-week energy. Planning to set a hard 10:30 PM bedtime alarm for this coming week."
P22,2026-W02,22.6,21.5,58.5,1987,6.4,"Week 2 completed with solid momentum from last week! I managed 3 out of 4 planned workouts (75% adherence), which feels realistic given the mid-week chaos. Monday's W25 session was strong - shoulder press back to 20kg after last week's reduction, which felt like a real win. Wednesday I had to skip W21 due to a work deadline that ran until 9pm, and I was too mentally drained to hit the gym safely. Made it up with a great Friday W25 session where deadlifts felt powerful at 65kg. Saturday's W21 was solid but I could feel the accumulated fatigue in my legs during squats.

Nutrition was better this week - hit protein targets 6 out of 7 days (86%), averaging about 128g daily. Sunday I fell short at 95g because I got caught up in errands and relied on quick carb-heavy meals. The batch prep from last Sunday carried me through Tuesday, then I did a mid-week mini-prep Wednesday night (grilled chicken breasts, quinoa, steamed broccoli) that saved me. Budget management improved significantly - stayed within 48 SAR/day average, only going over by 6 SAR total for the week. Skipped the Thursday shawarma temptation by packing leftover lentil soup!

Sleep remains my biggest challenge. Averaged 6.4 hours (range 5.8-7.1), with Tuesday being particularly rough at 5.8 hours due to neighborhood noise. I noticed the direct impact on Wednesday - low energy, skipped workout, craved sugary foods. Friday I prioritized sleep (7.1 hours) and it showed in Saturday's performance. My Garmin is yelling at me about recovery scores.

Body composition changes are encouraging! My jeans fit noticeably better around the waist, and I'm seeing more definition in my shoulders and upper back. The scale only dropped 0.2kg, but I feel leaner and stronger. Taking progress photos Saturday morning showed visible changes compared to two weeks ago - less softness around my midsection, more muscle visibility in my arms.

Recovery practices were consistent: foam rolled 6/7 days (skipped Sunday due to time), took magnesium and vitamin D daily, protein intake within 30 minutes post-workout on all training days. Added an extra rest day between Friday and Saturday workouts which helped with the heavy leg session.

Barriers this week: Wednesday work stress (led to missed workout), Tuesday sleep disruption (affected Wednesday performance), Sunday time management (led to poor nutrition). Wins: better budget control, higher protein adherence, shoulder press back to full weight, visible body composition improvements, successful mid-week meal prep adjustment.

For next week: need to protect sleep better (maybe earplugs for noisy nights?), keep the mid-week prep strategy, and plan a backup for Sunday meals. The recomposition is clearly working - strength maintaining/improving while body fat visibly decreasing. Age-appropriate programming is paying off with no injury issues despite the intensity."
P22,2026-W03,22.3,21.7,58.2,2018,6.4,"Week 3 was a mixed bag with some really strong moments and a couple of challenging days. Started the week feeling confident after seeing those body composition changes in Week 2, but life threw some curveballs. Monday's W25 workout was excellent - shoulder press felt solid at 20kg again and I'm really happy that strength is holding. Tuesday I had another rough night sleep (only 6.1 hours - construction started early in the neighborhood again) which made Wednesday's workout harder than it should have been. I completed the W21 session but my squat form felt off and I had to really focus to keep proper depth. The fatigue was real.

Thursday was a rest day that I desperately needed. Friday's W25 session was probably my best of the week - got 7.0 hours sleep Thursday night and it showed. Deadlifts felt powerful at 65kg, maybe even had more in the tank. Saturday's W21 was solid but not spectacular; legs were still a bit tired from Friday which is becoming a pattern I need to watch. Sunday was full rest and meal prep day.

Nutrition-wise, I hit 6 out of 7 days for protein targets (around 125-130g on good days), but Wednesday was rough - only managed about 98g because I was so tired I just wanted simple carbs and went to bed early. Budget was excellent again: averaged 47.5 SAR/day, total of 332.5 SAR for the week, well under my 350 SAR budget. The mid-week mini-prep is really working for me - I did it again on Wednesday evening (even though I was tired) and it saved Thursday and Friday meals.

Body composition continues to trend positively. The scale barely moved (down 0.3kg) but my jeans are definitely looser in the waist and I can see more definition in my shoulders and upper back. My sports bra fits differently - less back fat spillage. I took progress photos on Sunday and comparing to Week 1, there's a visible difference in my midsection and arms. This recomposition thing is real!

Sleep averaged 6.4 hours again (range 5.9-7.0 hours), which isn't ideal but it's consistent. I really notice the difference on workout days following good sleep versus poor sleep. Recovery practices were good: foam rolled 6 out of 7 days, kept up with my supplements (multivitamin, omega-3, vitamin D), and hydration was adequate all week.

Barriers this week: neighborhood construction noise (Tuesday and Thursday mornings), some work stress mid-week but nothing like Week 2's deadline crisis, and general fatigue from accumulated sleep debt. The positive is that I'm learning to work around these issues - I completed all 4 planned workouts this week (100% adherence!) even when I didn't feel optimal.

Looking ahead: I want to maintain this 4-workout schedule, keep the mid-week meal prep habit, and maybe try to get to bed 15 minutes earlier to see if I can push that sleep average up to 6.5-6.7 hours. Strength is holding well, body composition is improving, and I feel like I'm finding a sustainable rhythm. Age 45+ recovery is real though - I need those rest days and can't push through fatigue like I could in my 30s."
P22,2026-W04,21.9,21.8,57.8,2073,6.3,"Week 4 was a solid continuation of my recomposition journey, though I definitely felt the accumulated fatigue catching up with me. I completed all 4 scheduled workouts (100% adherence again!), which I'm really proud of, but the sleep debt from previous weeks made some sessions feel harder than they should have been. Monday's W25 shoulder press felt strong - I'm getting more comfortable with the 20kg, and my form is improving. Wednesday's W21 was tough; I had only 6.2 hours of sleep Tuesday night due to that ongoing construction noise, and I could feel it in my legs during squats. I had to really focus on form and took slightly longer rest periods. Friday's W25 deadlift session was interesting - I tested 67.5kg (up from 65kg) and it moved well, confirming I had room to progress. My coach was right about being undertrained on deadlifts. Saturday's W21 was completed but I felt general fatigue throughout. Nutrition was good overall - hit my protein target 6 out of 7 days (average 127g/day). Thursday I only managed 103g because I had a late work meeting and ended up eating a lighter dinner. My Sunday meal prep included chicken breast, ground turkey, quinoa, sweet potatoes, and roasted vegetables, which carried me through most of the week. Wednesday evening I did another mini-prep session (becoming a habit now) with grilled chicken thighs and cauliflower rice. Budget was excellent again - averaged 48.2 SAR/day, staying well under my 50 SAR limit. The scale showed -0.4kg this week, but more importantly, I'm seeing continued body composition changes. My jeans are noticeably looser in the waist, and I had to tighten my belt one more notch. My shoulders and upper back are showing more definition, especially in the mirror after workouts. A coworker even commented that I look 'leaner and stronger' which was a nice validation. Sleep averaged 6.3 hours this week (range 5.8-6.9 hours), which is slightly down from last week's 6.4 hours. The construction is still ongoing, and I'm definitely feeling the cumulative effect of not quite getting enough rest. I'm prioritizing getting to bed earlier this coming week. Recovery routine stayed consistent - foam rolled 6/7 days, took my supplements daily. One concern: I'm noticing more general fatigue and my resting heart rate seems slightly elevated in the mornings (around 58-60 bpm vs my usual 54-56 bpm), which I think is a sign I need more recovery. I'm being very mindful about not pushing into overtraining territory, especially at my age. The recomposition is clearly working - losing fat while maintaining/building muscle - but I need to respect the recovery demands. Planning to focus on sleep quality this coming week and maybe add an extra rest day if needed."
P22,2026-W05,21.6,21.9,57.5,2078,6.4,"Week 5 was a real test of resilience. I went in knowing I was carrying sleep debt from the previous week, and unfortunately the construction noise continued through Wednesday, making quality sleep elusive. I completed all 4 scheduled workouts (100% adherence maintained), but I could feel the accumulated fatigue in every session—especially the Wednesday W21 workout which felt like I was moving through mud. 

The Monday W25 session started strong with shoulder press at 20kg feeling solid, and I managed to push deadlifts to 70kg for working sets, which felt like a real milestone. But by Wednesday, my body was screaming for rest. I took longer rest periods and really focused on form over ego, which was the right call. Friday's W25 felt better after prioritizing an earlier bedtime Thursday night (managed 7.1 hours!), and I hit 70kg deadlifts again with better bar speed. Saturday's W21 was completed but with noticeable fatigue—I could feel my CNS was taxed.

Nutrition was excellent this week: 6/7 days hit protein targets, averaging 129g/day. Only Sunday fell short at 108g due to a social lunch that threw off my meal timing. Budget came in beautifully at 46.8 SAR/day average (327.6 SAR total), well under my 350 SAR budget. My batch cooking routine is now second nature—Sunday prep covered most of the week, and I did a quick Wednesday evening session for variety.

The scale showed -0.3kg change, but honestly, the mirror and my clothes tell a better story. My work trousers are noticeably looser in the waist, and I can see more definition in my shoulders and upper back. A gym acquaintance asked if I'd lost weight, which was validating. The recomposition is definitely happening, even if slowly.

Sleep averaged 6.4 hours this week (range 5.9-7.1h), a slight improvement from last week's 6.3h, but still not optimal. The construction finally stopped Thursday, thank goodness. I noticed my resting heart rate stayed elevated (58-61 bpm) most mornings, confirming I'm not fully recovered. By Sunday evening, I was genuinely exhausted.

Recovery work was solid: foam rolled 6/7 days, kept up with supplements, and even added an extra 10-minute stretching session on rest days. Hydration was good throughout.

Looking ahead, I'm considering adding a strategic deload or extra rest day next week if the fatigue doesn't resolve. At 48 years old, I can't just push through like I could in my 30s—smart training beats stubborn training. The strength gains are there (deadlift 67.5kg→70kg is significant), but I need to respect my body's recovery signals. The recomposition goal is progressing well, but sustainability requires better sleep management."
P22,2026-W06,21.3,21.95,57.1,2010,6.6,"Week 6 (2026-W06) completed with mixed outcomes - maintained workout adherence but faced significant recovery challenges that required mid-week adjustment. Started strong Monday/Wednesday but accumulated fatigue from previous weeks finally caught up Thursday, forcing me to make the mature decision to convert Saturday's planned W21 session into active recovery (20min walk + extended stretching). This was difficult mentally as I hate breaking streaks, but my elevated resting HR (60-62 bpm all week) and persistent muscle soreness screamed that my 45+ body needed respect. The decision paid off - by Sunday I felt genuinely refreshed for the first time in 3 weeks.

Workout quality: Monday W25 was solid despite some residual fatigue (deadlift 70kg x5 felt heavier than previous week, but form stayed tight). Wednesday W21 was surprisingly good - the upper body focus gave my legs recovery time and I hit all sets with decent energy. Friday W25 was the turning point - deadlift warmups felt like grinding through concrete, bar speed was terrible, and I made the call mid-session to cut volume by 30% rather than compromise form or risk injury. That experience made Saturday's decision to skip easier.

Nutrition was excellent: 6/7 days hit protein targets (average 128g/day, only Saturday at 115g due to appetite suppression from fatigue). Budget management remains strong at 48.2 SAR/day average, though I splurged slightly on extra salmon Thursday (52 SAR that day) because I was craving omega-3s and my body seemed to be asking for it. Sunday batch prep went smoothly - 1.1kg chicken breast, 900g ground turkey, roasted vegetables, quinoa all portioned for the week.

Sleep improved to 6.6h average (range 6.1-7.3h) with construction noise fully resolved. Thursday night's 7.3h was glorious and probably what kept me functional through Friday. Body composition continues trending positively despite the deload - work trousers now require a belt (never needed one before), and I caught my reflection at the gym Friday noticing actual shoulder cap definition. Scale dropped another 0.4kg to 57.1kg, but measurements tell the real story: waist down 1cm, shoulders same (maintaining muscle while losing fat exactly as intended).

The strategic deload decision feels right for long-term progress. I'm 47 years old, not 27, and pushing through accumulated fatigue would've led to injury or burnout. Three quality workouts this week beats four compromised ones. Planning to resume full 4-day schedule Week 7 with this reset, and I'm considering programming an intentional deload week every 6-8 weeks going forward.

Key wins: mature recovery decision-making, continued nutrition discipline, visible body composition improvements, better sleep environment. Areas for focus: maintaining this recovery awareness, possibly adding a 5-minute morning mobility routine to support workout quality, continuing the Sunday batch prep habit that's now completely automatic."
P22,2026-W07,20.8,22.1,56.6,2047,6.6,"Week 7 felt like a breakthrough week after last week's strategic deload. Energy levels were noticeably higher, and I hit all 4 planned workouts with solid performance across the board. Monday W25 felt strong—deadlifts at 70kg moved with better bar speed than last week, which was reassuring. Wednesday W21 upper body session was excellent, really feeling the shoulder and back development. Friday W25 was challenging but manageable, maintained full volume without the grinding sensation from Week 6. Sunday W21 closed the week well, though I noticed some fatigue creeping in toward the end.

Nutrition was excellent this week—6/7 days hit protein targets averaging 131g/day, which is above my 127g goal. Thursday was the only miss at 118g due to a rushed workday and skipping my afternoon snack. Budget management was spot-on at 49.1 SAR/day average, staying comfortably under my 50 SAR limit. Sunday I splurged slightly at 53 SAR on extra Greek yogurt and berries because I was craving something fresh after a week of batch-prepped meals.

Sleep averaged 6.6 hours again—same as last week but felt more restorative. Best night was Saturday at 7.1 hours, worst was Thursday at 6.0 hours (work stress kept my mind racing). I'm noticing that when I get 7+ hours, my workout performance the next day is markedly better. Need to keep prioritizing that bedtime routine.

Body composition changes are exciting! Scale shows -0.5kg to 56.6kg, but more importantly, I can see continued definition in my shoulders and arms. My work trousers are definitely looser—I'm on the tightest belt notch now. The mirror at the gym shows visible shoulder caps and some upper back definition that wasn't there a month ago. This recomposition approach is working beautifully.

Recovery protocols stayed consistent: foam rolling 7/7 days (15-20 minutes each evening while watching TV—totally habitual now), supplements on point, and I added an extra 10-minute stretching session on Tuesday evening when my hip flexors felt tight. Resting heart rate normalized to 55-57 bpm this week, down from the elevated 60-62 bpm last week, confirming the deload was necessary.

Barriers were minimal this week. Thursday was tough with the work deadline creating time pressure—I almost skipped my workout but pushed through with a slightly abbreviated session (45 minutes instead of 60). The accumulated experience from 7 weeks of consistency made it easier to adapt rather than abandon the workout entirely. Also, Wednesday evening I felt a twinge in my lower back during deadlift warmups, so I immediately dropped weight by 10% and focused on perfect form—mature decision-making paying off.

Cooking remains fully habitual. Sunday batch prep took 2.5 hours: 1.2kg chicken breast, 950g ground turkey, large batch of quinoa, roasted vegetables (bell peppers, zucchini, broccoli). This routine is so ingrained now that I don't even think about it—just put on a podcast and get it done.

Key insights: The deload week was absolutely necessary and set me up for a strong Week 7. Planning another intentional deload for Week 12 or 13. Seeing the visual body composition changes is incredibly motivating—more so than the scale number. Sleep remains the variable I need to control better; 7+ hours makes a massive difference in performance and recovery. At 47, respecting recovery signals and making mature training decisions is proving to be the key to sustainable progress. Overall, this was one of my best weeks yet—strong adherence, excellent nutrition, all workouts completed with good quality, and visible progress continuing."
P22,2026-W08,20.4,22.2,56.3,1965,6.6,"Week 8 complete - another solid week with 4/4 workouts done! Feeling strong and the recomposition continues. Monday's W25 session felt powerful, hit 72kg deadlift for a smooth double (2kg PR from last week). Wednesday W21 upper body work was excellent - shoulders feeling fuller and stronger. Friday W25 was challenging mid-week due to accumulated fatigue, but pushed through all volume. Sunday W21 finished strong despite some end-of-week tiredness. 

Nutrition was good at 83% adherence (5.8/7 days) - hit protein target most days averaging 128g (vs 124g target), but Tuesday fell short at 109g when afternoon meeting ran late and I missed my snack window. Saturday also slightly under at 117g. Budget management excellent at 48.7 SAR/day average (340.9 SAR total vs 350 budget, 9.1 SAR under). Thursday splurged 54 SAR on salmon and fresh vegetables which was worth it for meal variety.

Sleep averaged 6.6h again (range 6.1-7.2h) - Thursday night was rough at 6.1h due to neighbor noise, but Saturday caught up with 7.2h which helped Sunday's workout. Recovery protocols solid: foam rolled 7/7 days (15-20min nightly), stretching routine consistent, resting HR holding at 55-56 bpm.

Body composition continuing the right direction - scale shows 56.3kg (down 0.3kg from Week 7's 56.6kg), but measurements tell the better story: waist down another 0.5cm, arms up slightly, and the mirror shows continued shoulder/back definition. Work pants now comfortably at tightest notch. The recomposition is real!

Strength gains: deadlift 72kg x2 (PR), other lifts maintained or small progressions. Bar speed feeling snappy. No injuries or tweaks this week - the proactive approach to form and recovery is paying off. Friday's session was mentally tough (work stress carrying over) but completed all prescribed volume.

Barriers: Tuesday afternoon meeting disrupted nutrition timing, Thursday night sleep disrupted by neighbors, Friday mental fatigue from work. All managed without derailing the week. Cooking: Sunday batch prep 2.5h (chicken 1.3kg, ground turkey 900g, sweet potatoes, broccoli/peppers) - this routine is now completely automatic.

Key insights: consistency is compounding, visual changes exceeding scale changes (muscle gaining while fat losing), sleep quality at 7+ hours makes huge difference in workout quality, deadlift responding well to the progressive overload. Energy levels moderate-high 6/7 days (Friday dip due to work stress). Hydration good all week.

Looking ahead: Week 9 will continue current progression, watching for any fatigue accumulation signs. Planning deload for Week 12-13 as previously noted. Very pleased with 8 weeks of sustained progress - the intermediate training block is working perfectly for recomposition goals!"
P22,2026-W09,19.9,22.3,55.9,1978,6.6,"Week 9 complete - third consecutive 100% workout week! This is becoming a legitimate habit. Monday's W25 session felt strong despite some early-week fatigue from the weekend. Deadlifts at 72kg felt smoother than last week, which tells me I'm adapting well. Wednesday's W21 upper body work was solid, shoulder press moving well. Friday's W25 was the toughest - accumulated fatigue from work and training caught up, but I pushed through every set. Sunday's W21 finished the week nicely, though I could feel the volume.

Nutrition was good at 86% adherence (6/7 days hit protein target). Thursday was the only miss at 118g due to a long work day that threw off my meal timing - I ended up eating dinner later than planned and just couldn't fit in my evening snack. Every other day I hit 124g+ protein, with Saturday being exceptional at 142g when I had extra time to cook a proper weekend meal.

Budget stayed tight at 49.2 SAR/day average (344.4 SAR total vs 350 SAR budget). I'm getting really efficient with bulk purchases and meal prep. The Sunday 2.5-hour batch cook is non-negotiable now - it sets me up for success all week.

Sleep averaged 6.6h again (range 6.0-7.3h). Tuesday night was rough at 6.0h - some work stress kept my mind racing. But Saturday I got 7.3h which felt amazing and definitely helped with Sunday's workout. I notice such a difference in bar speed and mental focus when I get 7+ hours.

Body composition continues to impress me more than the scale. Weight dropped another 0.4kg to 55.9kg, but my work pants are now comfortable at the tightest notch without any pulling, and I can see shoulder definition even in regular lighting. My waist is down another 0.4cm based on how my belt sits. The recomposition is real - I'm losing fat while maintaining or even building muscle.

Recovery was excellent: 7/7 days foam rolling (15-20min each night, completely automatic now), resting heart rate holding at 55 bpm, no significant soreness. Thursday I had some upper back tightness from desk work, but foam rolling cleared it up.

Barriers this week: Tuesday sleep disruption from work stress, Thursday nutrition timing miss from long work day, Friday mental fatigue made the workout feel harder than it should have. But I worked through all of them.

Key win: Three straight weeks of 100% workout adherence. The momentum is building. Deadlift felt smoother at 72kg, suggesting I'm ready for another small progression soon. Visual changes continue to motivate me more than scale numbers. Deload still planned for Week 12-13, but right now I'm riding this wave of consistency."

My energy dipped mid-week, likely due to the calorie deficit combined with less-than-ideal sleep. By the weekend I felt leaner and my clothes fit slightly better. The kabsa was a family favorite and easy to prep in batches."
P22,2026-W26,11.7,25.6,53.5,1950,7,"Overall a solid first week! I managed to stick to the meal plan about 70% of the time - the Foul Medames breakfast was filling and easy to prep ahead. I did swap the samboosa snack for Greek yogurt with nuts twice when I was short on time. The gym workouts were challenging but appropriate for my level. I hit all 4 training days this week. The upper body session left me pleasantly sore for two days, and the leg workouts were intense but manageable. I noticed I'm sleeping slightly better, probably from the structured routine and increased activity. Energy levels have been good throughout the day, though I did feel hungry between meals on two occasions and added an extra piece of fruit. The calorie target felt about right - not overly restrictive. I can see minor improvements in muscle definition already, particularly in my shoulders and arms."

P23,2025-W46,32.5,41,107.1,1920,6.6,"This week was tougher than I expected. The diet plan itself wasn't bad - I actually enjoyed the ful medames for breakfast and the kabsa reminded me of home cooking. But sticking to it every single day? That was hard. I missed about 3-4 meals throughout the week, usually the afternoon labneh snack because I got busy at work. The workouts were really challenging - I think 'Advanced' level was too much for me as a beginner. I could only complete about half the exercises properly and had to skip some sets. My knees hurt after the leg day. On the positive side, I did make it to the gym all 3 days which I'm proud of. Sleep was rough - still averaging around 6-7 hours, woke up tired most mornings. I think I need easier workouts and maybe more flexibility in the meal plan."
P23,2025-W47,32.1,41.1,106.3,2450,6.5,"This week was a real grind, honestly. The diet plan felt overwhelming from day one - 3267 calories is a lot to track and prepare when you're just learning to cook. I tried my best but kept missing snacks and sometimes just grabbed whatever was convenient. The workouts were brutal. Three sessions with W33, W29, and W21 programs felt too advanced for where I'm at. I managed to show up for all three gym days, which I'm proud of, but had to scale back weights significantly and skip some of the more complex movements. My shoulders were sore for days after the first session. Sleep didn't improve - still hovering around 6-7 hours with work stress keeping me up. By Wednesday I was dragging. The evening hunger hit hard on days 2, 4, and 6, and I'll admit I went over my portions at dinner a couple times. On the positive side, I did feel slightly less bloated by the end of the week, and my energy during workouts improved marginally by day 5. The 30 SAR daily budget was tight - had to choose between quality protein sources and variety. Ended up eating a lot of chicken and rice. I think I need a simpler meal plan and definitely easier workouts to build confidence."
P23,2025-W48,31.8,41.2,105.6,2680,6.5,"This week was a real grind, honestly. Started Monday with good intentions, but by Tuesday I was already feeling the effects of another short night's sleep and the repetitive meals. The chicken and rice combo gets old fast when you're on a tight budget. I managed to hit the gym all three times (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) which I'm proud of, but I had to scale back the weights significantly - probably 35-40% lighter than prescribed. My shoulders were particularly sore from W33's upper body work, and that carried through the week.

Diet adherence was rough. I'd say I stuck to maybe 50% of the plan. Missed morning snacks on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday because I was rushing to work or just forgot. The evening snacks got skipped Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday - partly because I ran out of the budget-friendly options and partly because I was just too tired to care. On Thursday and Saturday nights, I definitely overate at dinner. Thursday was a work stress thing, and Saturday I was just really hungry after a long day.

The workouts themselves were challenging but doable when I modified them. W29 (Wednesday's leg day) left me hobbling for two days - those squats and lunges really hit hard even at reduced weight. W21 on Friday was more manageable, but I skipped some of the accessory exercises because my energy was just gone by that point. Sleep stayed consistent at around 6.5 hours, which isn't helping my recovery at all. I know I need more, but work stress and some late-night scrolling kept me up.

Hunger was an issue on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evenings - that gnawing feeling that makes you want to raid the fridge. Water intake was all over the place; some days I did okay, others I barely drank anything until evening. The afternoon energy crashes hit me Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, making it hard to stay focused at work.

On the positive side, I do feel like I'm building a routine. Three gym sessions completed is better than zero, and even at 50% diet adherence, I'm more conscious of what I'm eating than I was before. My clothes might be fitting slightly better, but it's hard to tell after just one week. The DOMS (muscle soreness) was constant but manageable - actually felt kind of good knowing I was working my muscles.

Biggest barriers this week: budget limitations leading to meal boredom, insufficient sleep affecting energy and willpower, work stress triggering overeating, and general fatigue making it hard to prep meals or stick to the snack schedule. Moving forward, I need to find more budget-friendly variety in meals, work on that sleep schedule, and maybe prep snacks in advance so I don't skip them."
P23,2025-W49,31.6,41.3,105.1,2650,6.5,"Week 49 was a grind, honestly. Started at 105.6kg and I'm feeling the weight of everything - literally and figuratively. The workouts happened, which is something I'm proud of, but they were HARD. My adherence to the diet plan was spotty again, probably hit about 55% of what I was supposed to do. The 30 SAR budget keeps me eating the same rotation of rice, chicken, eggs, and whatever vegetables are cheap at the market. By day 3, I was already tired of it.

Monday's workout (W33) left me sore for two days - my legs were screaming. I modified most exercises and took longer rests than programmed. Wednesday (W29) was better, but I was dragging from only getting 6 hours sleep. Friday (W21) I almost skipped entirely because of work stress, but I forced myself to do a shortened version.

The 6.5 hours of sleep isn't cutting it. I wake up tired, hit an energy wall around 2-3pm every day, and by evening I'm ravenous. Had a couple nights where I broke and ate extra bread or rice just to feel full. Water intake was inconsistent - some days I did okay, others I barely drank anything until dinner.

Budget constraints are real. I'm eating a lot of eggs (cheap protein), rice, frozen vegetables, and chicken when I can afford it. Meal prep is still a challenge with my beginner cooking skills. A few meals were just scrambled eggs and rice because I didn't have energy to cook properly.

Positives: I showed up for all three workouts even when I didn't want to. I can feel my body adapting slightly - the soreness is a bit less severe than previous weeks. I'm learning which exercises I need to modify. The scale moved down a tiny bit, which keeps me motivated.

Struggles: Evening hunger is brutal. Work stress makes it hard to stay consistent. I'm not recovering well with this sleep pattern. My body fat percentage feels stubborn. I know at 45+ and being a beginner, progress will be slow, but it's frustrating. Some days I question if this is worth it, but then I remember why I started - I need to get healthier for the long term."
P23,2025-W50,31.3,41.4,104.6,2875,6.5,"Week 50 was a grind, honestly. Started Monday with decent energy for my W33 workout, but by Wednesday I was dragging. The 6.5 hours of sleep just isn't cutting it—I wake up feeling like I need another hour or two. Work threw some curveballs mid-week (two particularly stressful days with back-to-back meetings), which killed my motivation to meal prep properly. I ended up eating the same boring rotation: scrambled eggs for breakfast, rice with chicken for lunch and dinner, some frozen veggies when I remembered. Got so sick of it by Thursday that I grabbed an extra shawarma wrap after work—not in the plan, but I was starving and mentally exhausted.

Workouts were mixed. Monday's W33 session felt strong despite some modifications—I'm still not hitting the prescribed weights, but I pushed through. Wednesday's W29 was harder; my legs were still sore, and I had to take extra rest between sets. Friday's W21 was actually the best of the week—maybe because I knew the weekend was coming. I'm noticing I can't recover like I used to; the DOMS lingers longer than it should, probably the sleep and age catching up with me.

Hunger was a real issue this week. Three nights I found myself raiding the kitchen around 9 PM, adding extra rice or bread just to feel satisfied. My water intake was inconsistent—hit maybe 1.5L on good days, but two days I barely drank a liter. Afternoon energy crashes were brutal, especially Tuesday and Thursday. I tried pushing through with black coffee, but it only helped so much.

Diet adherence was around 50-55%, I'd estimate. I stuck to the calorie target loosely, but definitely went over on two days with those evening snack attacks. Protein was okay most days thanks to the chicken and eggs, but I know I'm missing out on variety and probably some nutrients. The 30 SAR budget is tight—I can't afford much beyond basics, and the monotony is wearing on me.

On the positive side, I completed all three scheduled workouts without skipping, which feels like a win given how tired I've been. I'm starting to notice small changes—my shirts feel slightly less tight around the midsection, and I think my arms look a bit more defined. The scale hasn't moved dramatically, but I wasn't expecting miracles in one week. I'm down maybe half a kilo, which feels realistic given my partial adherence and the fact that I'm just starting out.

Overall, I'd say this week was a 6/10. I showed up, did the work, but the barriers (sleep, stress, budget, hunger) definitely held me back from being fully consistent. Need to figure out how to manage those evening hunger episodes better—maybe shifting more calories to dinner or having a planned snack. Also need to prioritize sleep somehow, though with my schedule that's easier said than done."
P23,2025-W51,31.1,41.45,104.2,2180,6.5,"Week 51 was a continuation of the struggle, honestly. Started Monday morning feeling optimistic after last week's small progress, but the reality of maintaining this routine hit hard. The workouts themselves went better than expected - I'm noticing I can push a bit harder now, which is encouraging. But the diet side? That's where I keep stumbling. The same chicken and rice combo is wearing me down mentally. By Wednesday, I was so tired of eating the same thing that I almost ordered takeout, but remembered my 30 SAR budget wouldn't allow it without sacrificing other meals. Thursday was particularly rough - work was chaos, I skipped my planned workout (only managed 2 out of 3 this week), and ended up eating an extra portion of rice late at night because I was starving and couldn't sleep. The 6.5 hours of sleep isn't cutting it for recovery, I can feel it in my joints and energy levels. Friday I tried to get back on track, did my workout, but the afternoon energy crash was brutal. Weekend was mixed - Saturday I meal prepped which helped, but Sunday I had a family gathering and ate more than planned. The scale isn't moving as fast as I'd hoped, which is discouraging. I know I'm only at 52% adherence, but it feels like I'm trying harder than that number suggests. Water intake was poor again, maybe 1.5L most days. My body feels slightly different though - pants are a tiny bit looser, so something is happening. Just wish it was faster and easier."
P23,2025-W52,31.4,41.35,104.4,2920,6.3,"Week 52 was honestly one of the toughest weeks I've had in a while. Started Monday with decent intentions - got my W33 workout done early morning before work, felt good about that. The workout itself was challenging but manageable, though I'm still feeling like a beginner even after all these weeks. Tuesday and Wednesday the diet held together okay, stuck to my basic meal prep routine though I'm so tired of eating the same chicken and rice combinations. The monotony is really getting to me now.

Thursday was supposed to be my W29 workout day, but work absolutely crushed me. Had a major deadline and stayed late, got home around 8pm completely drained. Skipped the workout and honestly just made myself a quick meal and crashed. Sleep that night was terrible - maybe 5.5 hours - kept waking up thinking about work stuff. Friday I was dragging all day, the afternoon energy dip hit me like a truck. Had 4 cups of coffee just to stay functional. Ended up eating an extra serving at dinner because I was genuinely starving, probably added 300-400 extra calories.

Saturday I managed to get the W21 workout in, moved it from Thursday. It was rough - my body felt heavy and uncooperative. The DOMS from Monday's session had mostly faded but I wasn't feeling strong at all. Diet-wise Saturday was okay until evening when I got hit with serious hunger pangs around 9pm. Ended up having some extra bread with cheese, maybe 250 extra calories. Sleep Saturday night was poor again, around 6 hours but restless.

Sunday was a mixed bag. No workout scheduled which was a relief honestly. But we had an extended family thing in the afternoon - my brother's place. I tried to be mindful but there was a lot of food, traditional dishes, desserts. I didn't go crazy but definitely ate more than my plan, probably 500+ extra calories. The social pressure is real, and honestly after a tough week I didn't have the willpower to be super strict.

Overall completed 2 of 3 workouts again, which seems to be my pattern lately. Diet adherence was maybe 50% - I kept the basic structure most days but had 4 days with extra portions or unplanned eating (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday). Water intake was poor again, probably averaging 1.4-1.5L. The 30 SAR daily budget is holding but the food boredom is intense. I'm seeing very minimal progress on the scale and it's honestly demotivating. My clothes might fit slightly better but it's hard to tell. The combination of poor sleep (averaged maybe 6.3 hours this week), work stress, and diet fatigue is making everything harder. I know I need to push through but after 52 weeks I'm really feeling the grind."
P23,2026-W01,31.2,41.5,104.1,2730,6.2,"Starting Week 1 of 2026 feeling exhausted from last year's grind. It's like I'm running on fumes and the scale barely moved despite all that effort. Budget is still tight at 30 SAR/day, which means I'm eating the same bland rotation again. Monday was W33 workout day - got through it but felt heavy and sluggish. The exercises felt harder than they should, probably because I only slept 6 hours last night. Tuesday I skipped the workout (W29 was scheduled) because work dumped an urgent project on my desk and I was at the office until 8pm. Grabbed a shawarma on the way home (over budget, around 25 SAR) because I was too tired to cook. Wednesday I tried to get back on track with the diet - eggs and bread for breakfast, rice and chicken for lunch and dinner. But honestly, the food monotony is killing me. I'm so tired of eating the same things. Thursday was supposed to be rest, but I felt guilty about Tuesday so I did W29 workout in the evening. Mistake - I was already tired and the workout quality was poor. My legs were still sore from Monday. Friday I completely fell off the wagon. Work stress hit again, I had three cups of coffee just to function, and by evening I was starving. Ate an extra large dinner portion plus some biscuits while watching TV. Probably 600-700 kcal over target. Saturday was W21 workout which I actually enjoyed more - felt slightly better energy. But then evening came and I got hit with intense hunger, ended up eating extra rice and chicken, plus some leftover bread. Another 400 kcal over. Sunday was a family gathering at my brother's house - lots of kabsa, sweets, and social pressure to eat. I tried to be moderate but definitely overate by 500+ kcal. Sleep has been terrible all week, averaging maybe 6.2 hours with restless nights Wednesday and Friday. Water intake is poor, maybe 1.3-1.5L per day. I'm feeling discouraged and honestly questioning if this is worth it. A whole year of effort and I'm still over 100kg with barely visible changes. The scale moved down only 0.3kg this week despite doing 3 workouts, which feels like nothing for the effort. My clothes fit about the same. I'm battling constant fatigue, the food is boring, work keeps interfering, and I don't see the point sometimes. Maybe I'm just destined to be this weight. The only positive is I did manage all 3 workouts this week, even if Thursday's was subpar. But the diet adherence was maybe 50% at best - 4 days of excess eating out of 7. I need to figure out how to manage stress eating and evening hunger better, but when I'm exhausted from poor sleep and work pressure, willpower just evaporates."
P23,2026-W02,31.35,41.4,104.3,3450,6,"Week 2 started with some hope but honestly ended in a familiar pattern of frustration. I completed 2 out of 3 scheduled workouts which feels like a step backward from last week's perfect attendance. Monday's W33 workout went okay - not great, still feeling tired but I pushed through. Skipped Thursday's W29 completely because work exploded again with another urgent deadline and I was running on 5.5 hours of sleep. Managed W21 on Saturday morning which felt decent, probably my best session of the week.

Diet was a disaster again. Maybe hit my targets on 2-3 days max. Monday and Tuesday were okay-ish, stuck to the meal plan mostly. Wednesday I was so exhausted I grabbed a chicken shawarma wrap for lunch (wasn't even hungry, just stressed) and then overate at dinner because I felt like I'd already blown it. Thursday was terrible - the work stress plus skipping the workout made me feel like garbage, so I stress-ate through the evening, probably 600-700 kcal over. Friday was passable in the morning but evening hunger hit hard again. Weekend was mixed - Saturday morning good, but Saturday night I was starving after the workout and definitely overate. Sunday started fine but afternoon family visit meant traditional foods and I couldn't resist, probably another 400-500 kcal over.

Sleep is killing me. Averaged maybe 6 hours, with Wednesday and Thursday being particularly brutal (5.5 and 5.8 hours). I'm constantly tired, which makes everything harder - the workouts feel like climbing a mountain, and resisting food when I'm exhausted is nearly impossible. Coffee consumption is up again, hitting 4 cups on the bad days just to function.

The psychological toll is getting heavier. I'm now over a year into this effort and the scale barely moves. Lost maybe 0.2kg this week, which feels like nothing for all the suffering. I look in the mirror and still see the same person. The meals are so monotonous - chicken, rice, vegetables, repeat. I'm mentally exhausted from the constant calculation and restriction. Part of me wonders if this is even worth it anymore. Maybe this is just who I am now.

Budget was tight again. That Wednesday shawarma set me back about 23 SAR and created stress for the rest of the week. Had to skip buying extra vegetables I wanted. Water intake was poor, maybe 1.4L daily average. I know I should drink more but I just forget when I'm stressed or busy.

The missed Thursday workout really bothers me. I was doing so well last week with all three sessions, and now I'm back to skipping. The pattern feels inevitable - work pressure builds, sleep suffers, workout gets sacrificed, then I eat poorly because I feel bad about missing it. It's a cycle I can't seem to break.

I'm trying to stay committed but the motivation is at rock bottom. Every week feels like two steps forward, one step back. Or maybe one step forward, one step back. I don't even know anymore. The worst part is feeling like I'm letting myself down repeatedly. I start each week with intention and end it with disappointment.

Body feels okay physically - some soreness after Monday and Saturday workouts but nothing terrible. It's the mental exhaustion that's overwhelming. I need something to change but I don't know what. Maybe the approach, maybe my expectations, maybe my entire life situation. All I know is this current pattern isn't sustainable and I'm running out of energy to keep trying the same way."
P23,2026-W03,31,41.3,103.6,2350,6,"This week was challenging. The meal plan had way too many calories for fat loss - nearly 3000 kcal seems excessive when I'm trying to lose weight. I managed to stick to about half the meals as planned, but often reduced portions or skipped the 4th meal because I felt it was too much food. The workouts were labeled 'Advanced' but I'm a beginner, so I had to modify most exercises significantly. I could only complete about 2 of the 3 planned gym sessions - my body wasn't ready for that intensity. The chicken shawarma and grilled chicken were good, but cooking multiple meals daily with my beginner skills was time-consuming. Sleep remained poor around 6 hours due to work stress. I did see a small drop on the scale, probably from being more active and not eating my usual junk food, even though I wasn't fully adherent to this specific plan."
P23,2026-W04,32.6,41,107.2,2850,6.3,الأسبوع كان صعباً بصراحة. حاولت الالتزام بالنظام الغذائي والتمارين لكن ظروف العمل وقلة النوم أثرت علي كثير. ألم الظهر رجع لي في منتصف الأسبوع وهذا خلاني أتردد في بعض التمارين. الأكل الحلال مافيه مشكلة لكن أحياناً أنسى أسجل الوجبات أو أفوت وجبة بسبب الانشغال. حاولت أمشي شوي زيادة عن العادة لكن ما كنت منتظم. الميزان ما تغير كثير وهذا محبط شوي، لكن أعرف إني لازم أصبر وأستمر. المدرب داعمني والحمد لله، بس أحس إني محتاج أنظم وقتي أكثر ونومي لازم يتحسن عشان أقدر أكمل بشكل أفضل.
P23,2026-W05,32.3,41.1,106.7,3089,6.2,"Week 5 of 2026 is in the books. Honestly, it was a grind. Started Monday with good intentions - prepped some simple meals Sunday night (grilled chicken, rice, frozen veggies), but by Tuesday I was already behind. Work got hectic and I skipped breakfast both Tuesday and Thursday, grabbing a shawarma wrap instead of my planned meal around noon. That probably pushed me over on sodium those days. 

Workouts were tough. Managed two full sessions (W33 on Monday evening and W29 on Thursday), but had to bail on Saturday's W21 workout. My lower back started acting up again Wednesday night - that dull ache that tells me I overdid something. I think it was the bent-over rows on Monday, even though I kept the weight light. By Friday I was exhausted from another string of 6-hour sleep nights, so I pushed the third workout to Saturday morning, but woke up stiff and decided rest was smarter than pushing through pain.

The two workouts I did complete felt okay - kept RPE around 6-7 like I'm supposed to, did the bodyweight squats and modified push-ups from W33, then the resistance band work from W29. Sweated a good amount but energy was definitely not peak. Evening timing (around 20:45-21:15) is all I can manage with my schedule, but it's probably affecting my already poor sleep.

Diet adherence was maybe 55-60% this week. Hit my protein target on maybe 3 days - the chicken and some canned tuna helped. But I definitely went over on carbs a couple days (that shawarma wrap, plus I had rice with most dinners). Tracked what I could in my app but I know I'm probably off by 15-20% on portions. The 30 SAR daily budget is tight - spent about 210 SAR for the week on food, which is right at my limit. Had to buy pre-cooked rotisserie chicken twice (18 SAR each) because I didn't have energy to cook.

Step count was all over the place - got 5800 steps on Monday when I walked during lunch, but Tuesday and Wednesday were barely 3000. Averaged maybe 4100 for the week. 

Positive: I didn't completely give up. I showed up for two workouts even when tired. I made some decent food choices when I could. Negative: The back pain is concerning, sleep is still terrible (averaging just over 6 hours), and I feel like I'm treading water rather than making progress. Weight feels about the same, maybe down half a kilo but hard to tell with daily fluctuations. I'm noticing my pants fit slightly better around the waist, so maybe something is happening, but energy and motivation are low. Need to figure out this back issue and somehow get more sleep, or this is going to keep being a struggle."
P23,2026-W06,32.1,41.1,106.3,2950,6.2,"Week 6 was challenging but I managed to push through better than I expected given my back issues from last week. Started Monday feeling cautious about my lower back, which thankfully felt about 70% recovered. I completed 2 out of 3 planned workouts again - managed W33 on Monday evening and W29 on Thursday, but had to skip W21 on Saturday because I had a family gathering that ran late and I was completely exhausted by the time I got home around 22:30. 

Diet-wise, I'd say I hit around 55% adherence, similar to last week. The calorie target of 3186 felt quite high and honestly I don't think I reached it most days, which might be good for fat loss but I know the plan is designed for a reason. I tracked more carefully this week after realizing my 18% error rate last time. My estimates put me between 2700-3200 kcal most days. I skipped breakfast twice again (Tuesday and Friday) - mornings are just so rushed with work. Hit my protein target on 4 out of 7 days this time, which is an improvement. I've been trying to include more chicken and eggs when I remember.

The sodium is still a problem - I had takeout twice (Wednesday night after a long day, and Sunday lunch with family). Both times I know I went over the 2500mg limit. The shawarma place I go to is just so convenient and within budget, but I can feel the bloating the next day.

Budget was good - spent about 205 SAR for the week, staying under my 210 limit. I'm getting better at finding affordable protein sources at the local market.

Sleep averaged 6.2 hours again, ranging from 5.5 to 7 hours. Wednesday night was particularly bad (5.5 hours) because of work stress, but I managed 7 hours on Saturday which felt amazing. I can definitely tell the difference in my energy and motivation when I get closer to 7 hours.

The workouts I did complete felt manageable at RPE 6-7. My lower back held up well during W33 and W29, though I was very careful with form and took extra rest between sets. Step count averaged around 4200 this week - slightly better than last week's 4100, but still far from ideal. I'm trying to park further from the office entrance to add a few steps.

Motivation is moderate. I can see very minor changes when I look in the mirror - my shirts feel slightly less tight around the waist, which keeps me going. But the fatigue is real, especially mid-week. The 20:45-21:15 evening workout window is working when I can stick to it, though it does cut into my already limited sleep time.

Overall, I feel like I'm maintaining rather than making dramatic progress, but given my starting point and the barriers I'm facing (sleep, back pain, time constraints), I'm trying to be patient with myself. Small consistent steps forward."
P23,2026-W07,31.7,41.3,105.6,2950,6.1,"This week was challenging but showed incremental progress. I managed to complete all 3 scheduled workouts (Monday W33, Wednesday W29, Saturday W21), which is a personal best for me in recent weeks. The key was planning ahead - I moved Saturday's workout to early afternoon before my family commitment, which helped me avoid the fatigue that derailed me last week.

Diet adherence was around 58%, slightly better than last week's 55%. I tracked more consistently using my phone app, which helped me stay aware of portion sizes. My main wins were: hitting protein targets 5 out of 7 days (up from 4 last week), and only skipping breakfast once (Sunday, slept in after late Saturday night). However, I still struggled with sodium - exceeded limits 3 times this week due to convenience eating on Tuesday (shawarma wrap during work rush), Thursday (family ordered pizza), and Saturday evening (grabbed fast food after workout because I was starving and didn't meal prep).

Calorie intake ranged from 2600-3400 kcal across the week, averaging around 2950 kcal daily - still above my 2400 target but better controlled than previous weeks. The days I meal-prepped (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) were much better for adherence. My budget came in at 198 SAR for the week, which felt good - I'm learning to shop smarter with bulk chicken breast and frozen vegetables.

Sleep remained a struggle at 6.1 hours average (range 5.0-7.0 hrs). Tuesday night was particularly rough (5 hours) due to work stress, and I definitely felt it during Wednesday's workout - my energy was low and I had to reduce weights slightly on the compound movements. The nights I got 6.5-7 hours, I felt noticeably better.

Workout performance: Monday's W33 session felt strong (RPE 6.5), I'm seeing progression on my squat form and managed to add 2.5kg to the bar. Wednesday was tougher due to poor sleep (RPE 7.5), but I pushed through. Saturday's W21 workout was satisfying - completing it felt like a mental victory after skipping it last week. Lower back continues to feel good with no pain flares, which is encouraging.

Step count improved to ~4800 average this week. I started parking further from my office and taking a 10-minute walk during lunch break on 4 days, which added about 1000 steps daily on those days. Small change but it's helping.

I'm noticing my pants feel slightly looser around the waist, and my wife commented that my face looks less puffy. These small wins keep me motivated. The biggest barrier remains evening fatigue and the temptation to skip workouts or grab convenient (unhealthy) food. I'm trying to address this by doing more weekend meal prep, but my cooking skills are still pretty basic - I can handle grilled chicken, rice, and steamed vegetables, but variety is lacking and sometimes I just crave something different.

Overall, I'm cautiously optimistic. The consistency with workouts this week felt like a breakthrough, and if I can maintain this 3x/week pattern while tightening up the diet just a bit more, I think I'll start seeing more noticeable physical changes. Next week's focus: better meal prep variety and protecting my sleep schedule."
P23,2026-W08,31.4,41.4,104.9,3100,6.1,"Week 8 was a mixed bag - started strong but hit some walls mid-week. Monday's workout felt great, riding the momentum from last week's breakthrough. I actually woke up motivated, which hasn't happened in a while. Tuesday's eating was decent, stuck to the plan mostly. Wednesday was rough - only got 5 hours sleep because of work stress, and I could feel it during the workout. My energy was dragging, and I ended up grabbing a shawarma meal (about 1100 kcal) because I was too tired to prep anything. Thursday I skipped the planned rest day walk because exhaustion caught up. Friday's workout happened but felt like I was moving through mud - RPE was pushing 8 when it should've been 6.5. Weekend was better for sleep (got 7 hours Saturday night!), and Sunday's workout was solid again. The diet adherence dropped back to around 50% - I hit the protein targets 4 out of 7 days instead of 5, and sodium was high again (exceeded 4 times this week). Budget came in at 205 SAR, still under limit but higher than last week. The convenience eating crept back in when sleep got bad. Weight is down slightly which is encouraging, but I can feel the sleep debt affecting everything - recovery, food choices, motivation. The positive: I still hit all 3 workouts even when feeling rough, so that consistency is sticking. The challenge: I need to figure out this sleep thing because it's clearly the linchpin. When I'm tired, everything else falls apart - I eat worse, recovery suffers, and workouts feel harder than they should."
P23,2026-W09,31.3,41.5,105.2,3250,6.1,"Week 3 in the books, and honestly, it's been a rollercoaster. Started strong on Monday with good intentions after a decent weekend recovery, but the sleep debt hit me hard mid-week again. Tuesday and Wednesday were brutal - only got about 5 hours each night due to work deadlines and some anxiety about a project presentation. That lack of sleep made me reach for convenient, calorie-dense foods more than I'd like to admit.

The workouts? I'm actually proud of myself here. Despite feeling exhausted, I pushed through all three sessions (W33, W29, W21). Monday's W33 workout felt surprisingly good - I'm definitely noticing improvements in my stamina. The bodyweight exercises don't leave me as winded as they did three weeks ago. Wednesday's W29 session was tough though; I was running on fumes and had to take longer rest periods. The RPE hit about 8 during the burpees, and I seriously considered skipping it. Friday's W21 was moderate - I'd recovered a bit by then.

Nutrition-wise, this week was a step backward. I meal prepped on Sunday, but by Wednesday I was so tired that I grabbed shawarma twice and hit the drive-through for a late-night burger on Thursday. My protein intake was inconsistent - some days I nailed it, others I barely hit 150g. The sodium is creeping up again because of the restaurant food. I tracked about 3250 calories average, which is way above my 2400 target. The scale shows a small gain, which is frustrating but not surprising given the week I had.

The positive? My clothes are definitely fitting better around the waist. I can button my work pants without that uncomfortable tightness. My wife even commented that my face looks less puffy. These small wins keep me going.

Sleep averaged 6.1 hours again, but the distribution was worse - two nights under 5.5 hours really messed with my recovery and decision-making. I need to prioritize getting to bed earlier, especially before workout days. The cascade effect is real: bad sleep → poor food choices → guilt → stress → worse sleep.

Moving into week 4, I'm setting a specific goal: lights out by 10:30 PM at least 4 nights this week. If I can crack the sleep code, I think the nutrition will follow. Budget was fine at 198 SAR - stayed within limits even with the convenience meals because I balanced with cheaper options other days."

The advanced gym workouts were honestly too intense for my beginner fitness level - I had to scale back the weights significantly and couldn't complete all the sets. My legs were extremely sore after the leg day, which affected my motivation mid-week. The cooking was doable since the meals weren't too complex, though preparing everything took more time than expected.

I managed to follow about half the meals as planned, but often reduced portions because it felt like too much food. The workouts were labeled 'Advanced' but I'm a beginner, so I had to scale back significantly on weights and couldn't complete all sets. Did Pull day twice, Push once, and skipped legs due to lower back soreness. Sleep remained poor around 6 hours - work stress didn't help. I did lose a tiny bit of weight, probably from the 3 workout days and being more active, but honestly the calorie target seems wrong for fat loss. I'm 45, obese, and trying to lose fat - this felt more like a bulking plan. The Middle Eastern meals were tasty though, and within my budget."

Starting the week at 52.7kg, I managed to stick to the meal plan most days - I'd say about 5 out of 7 days I hit my targets pretty closely. Tuesday was a bit rough; I had a work deadline and ended up grabbing a shawarma wrap that pushed me over my calorie goal by about 300 calories. The 1825 kcal target felt manageable on most days, and my intermediate cooking skills helped me prep some decent meals within my 55 SAR daily budget.

Completed all four scheduled workouts (W25 and W21 alternating) which I'm proud of! The leg-focused sessions left me with noticeable DOMS for about 48 hours afterward, especially in my quads and glutes. By Thursday, I was walking a bit stiffly up the stairs at work. Energy levels were a mixed bag - the first two days I felt sluggish, probably because I'm only averaging 6.9 hours of sleep, but by mid-week I noticed a definite improvement. I think the consistent protein intake (114g daily target) is helping with recovery.

I did experience some water retention around Wednesday-Thursday. My rings felt tight and I looked a bit puffy in the mirror. Could be the sodium from that Tuesday meal, or possibly cycle-related since I'm in that age range where things fluctuate. By Saturday it had resolved itself. No injuries thankfully, though I was careful with form during the strength training sessions given my intermediate fitness level.

The budget constraint was real but manageable. I focused on eggs, chicken breast, lentils, and seasonal vegetables from the local market. Rice and whole wheat bread were my carb staples. I had to skip some of the fancier protein options I might have preferred, but I made it work. My 76% adherence propensity showed - I wanted to follow the plan perfectly, but life happened and I'm okay with that.

Wednesday's W21 cardio session felt surprisingly good despite the sleep debt catching up - got only 6.5 hours that night due to work stress. Thursday was my rest day and I meal prepped which helped tremendously for Friday and Saturday adherence. Friday's W25 felt harder than Monday, DOMS from Wednesday still lingering in calves. Saturday W21 was solid, felt energized. Sunday I allowed myself a small treat within budget - shared some dates and Arabic coffee with a friend. The 55 SAR daily budget is tight but manageable when I stick to staples. Bought a whole chicken this week which I portioned for multiple meals, very cost-effective. Sleep averaged slightly better at 7.1 hours but still not ideal. Energy levels moderate throughout, no major crashes. Water intake could be better, aiming for improvement next week. Overall feeling accomplished - hit all 4 workouts and stayed on track 6 out of 7 days with meals."
P24,2025-W49,27.5,17.85,52.2,1847,7.2,"Week 49 complete. Overall a solid week with good adherence despite some mid-week challenges. Started strong Monday and Tuesday, hitting all meals and workouts as planned. Wednesday brought unexpected fatigue - possibly from accumulated training volume - which affected my W25 session quality. I pushed through but had to reduce leg press weight by 5kg. Thursday was my rest day and I used it well for meal prep, cooking a whole chicken (26 SAR this week, prices stable) and preparing lentil soup for the next few days.

Friday's W21 workout felt much better after the rest day. Energy was back up and I completed all intervals with good form. Saturday I had a small social gathering in the afternoon which threw off my meal timing - ended up eating dinner quite late around 10pm, but stayed within my macros by choosing grilled chicken and a large salad. Sunday I felt slightly bloated from the late meal but completed my final W25 session of the week.

Diet adherence was approximately 78% this week - followed the meal plan 6 out of 7 days fully. Saturday's timing was off but calories were maintained. I did have an extra 100g of dates on Thursday evening (about 280 extra kcal) when I felt unusually hungry post-workout, which pushed me slightly over target that day. Protein targets were consistently met thanks to the chicken prep and my usual egg rotation.

Budget tracking: 54 SAR average daily spend. Whole chicken (26 SAR), eggs (12 SAR/30), rice (8 SAR/2kg), lentils (6 SAR), vegetables including cucumber, tomatoes, zucchini (15 SAR total), whole wheat bread (4 SAR), olive oil and spices (8 SAR). Total weekly: 379 SAR, well within my 385 SAR weekly allocation.

Sleep averaged 7.2 hours this week - slight improvement. Best nights were Monday (7.5h) and Thursday (7.8h). Worst was Saturday (6.5h) due to the social event running late. DOMS was moderate after Monday's W25 - quads and glutes mostly - but manageable and didn't impair daily activities. By Friday the soreness had resolved completely.

Positive observations: I'm noticing continued improvements in workout endurance. The W21 intervals that felt challenging 2-3 weeks ago are now feeling more sustainable. My recovery between sets is faster. Form remains solid across all exercises - I'm being very conscious of this especially on leg press and squats. Also noticed my resting heart rate seems slightly lower when I check in the mornings (around 64-66 bpm vs 68-70 a month ago).

Challenges: Mid-week fatigue is real. I might need to pay more attention to carb timing around Wednesday workouts. The late Saturday meal reminded me that social situations require planning - I should have eaten a small snack before going out. Also, the Thursday date craving was unusual for me; might indicate I need slightly more carbs on heavy training days or better distribution throughout the day.

Weight is holding relatively steady with very minor fluctuation. I feel like body composition is slowly improving - clothes fitting slightly better around the waist, and I can see a bit more definition in my legs. No water retention issues this week. Energy levels were good overall except for Wednesday's dip.

Looking ahead: Will continue with similar meal prep strategy as it's working well for budget and adherence. Planning to be more mindful of carb timing on workout days. Will maintain the 4-day training split as recovery is adequate and I'm seeing progress."
P24,2025-W50,27.1,17.95,51.9,1895,7.1,"This week started strong with good momentum from previous weeks. Monday's W25 workout felt solid despite some residual soreness from last week - I'm noticing my recovery is getting better. Tuesday's meal prep went smoothly and I stayed within budget at 52 SAR. Wednesday's W21 session was challenging; I felt fatigued mid-workout, possibly from accumulated training load, but pushed through with slightly reduced intensity on the last circuit. Thursday was my slip day - attended a colleague's farewell gathering and couldn't resist the date cake, went over by about 290 calories. Friday's W25 workout was excellent, felt energized and hit all my targets. Saturday I had a family lunch that pushed my meal timing late, but I planned ahead and kept portions reasonable, staying on target. Sunday's final W21 session felt strong, and I'm seeing visible improvements in my endurance - exercises that winded me 4 weeks ago now feel manageable. Sleep averaged around 7.1 hours this week, slightly down from last week due to Thursday's late event. Overall adherence was about 75% - 6/7 days on diet plan, 4/4 workouts completed. My clothes are fitting better and I feel more capable in daily activities. The budget averaged 54.5 SAR/day, well within my limit. Some mild DOMS Tuesday and Friday, but manageable. I'm pleased with the consistency even with life's interruptions."
P24,2025-W51,26.9,18.05,51.7,1876,7,"Week 51 complete! This was a solid week overall despite the holiday season ramping up. Started Monday strong with W25 - felt energized and my endurance continues to improve. Tuesday I had some lingering soreness but nothing concerning. Wednesday's W21 session went well, though I noticed I was slightly more fatigued than usual, probably from the busy pre-holiday schedule at work.

Diet adherence was good at around 78% this week. I had one planned overage on Friday evening (about +320 kcal) at a holiday gathering - made conscious choices but still enjoyed myself. The rest of the week I stayed pretty close to my 1838 kcal target. Meal prep on Sunday really helped me stay on track Monday through Thursday.

Thursday's W25 workout was probably my best of the week - felt strong and pushed through some challenging sets. Saturday's W21 session was solid but I could feel the week catching up with me energy-wise. My form stayed good throughout all workouts, no compromises there.

Sleep averaged 7.0 hours this week, slightly down from my usual 7.1, mainly because of some late-night holiday prep on Tuesday and Friday. Budget came in at 54.8 SAR/day, so right on target. I'm noticing my clothes fitting better and feeling more toned, especially in my arms and core.

The holiday season is definitely adding some scheduling challenges, but I'm managing well. Minor DOMS on Tuesday and Saturday mornings, but nothing that impacted my daily activities. Looking forward to maintaining this momentum through the holidays!"
P24,2025-W52,26.7,18.1,51.5,1912,6.9,"Week 52 complete! This was a solid week overall, though I definitely felt the cumulative effects of the holiday season. Started strong Monday with W25 - felt energized and hit all my targets. Tuesday I noticed some quad soreness from those lunges, but nothing that interfered with daily activities. Wednesday's W21 session was tougher than expected - I think the late nights from holiday gatherings caught up with me, and I had to modify the last set of burpees to step-backs instead of jumps. 

Diet adherence was good at 74% - right in my typical range considering the week. Had a planned family dinner Thursday that pushed me about 280 kcal over target, but I made conscious choices and didn't go overboard. Friday's W25 workout felt great - I think the extra carbs from Thursday actually helped my performance. Saturday was my struggle day - woke up tired (only 6.5 hours sleep) and the W21 workout felt like a grind. I completed it but definitely at lower intensity than usual.

Budget management was excellent this week at 54.2 SAR/day. I've really gotten the hang of meal prep efficiency. Made a big batch of lentil soup Sunday that carried me through several lunches, and the chicken thigh sales at the market helped keep protein costs down. The holiday season temptations were real, but I stayed focused on my goals.

Body composition feels like it's continuing in the right direction - clothes fitting well, strength maintaining nicely. No new aches or pains beyond normal DOMS. Sleep averaged slightly lower at 6.9 hours due to some end-of-year social commitments, but I managed fatigue well by listening to my body during workouts. Looking forward to a fresh start in the new year with hopefully more consistent sleep patterns!"
P24,2026-W01,26.5,18.15,51.4,1872,6.8,"Week 1 of 2026 is complete! I managed to stick to my plan pretty well despite the post-holiday adjustment period. Monday's W25 workout felt strong - I was energized after the break and ready to get back into routine. Diet adherence was solid at around 78% for the week, which I'm pleased with given the lingering holiday treats at home. 

Tuesday was a rest day and I focused on meal prep, which really helped set me up for success. Wednesday's W21 session was good, though I felt some residual fatigue from the holiday sleep disruption catching up with me. I modified one exercise slightly but completed everything else as planned.

Thursday I had a small overage at dinner (about +200 kcal) when my sister visited unexpectedly, but I made mindful choices and didn't let it derail me. Friday's W25 workout was excellent - felt strong and focused. My form felt really dialed in, especially on the compound movements.

The weekend was a bit challenging. Saturday's W21 session happened but I was dealing with some fatigue and minor lower back tightness, so I reduced the intensity slightly on two exercises. Sleep averaged 6.8 hours this week, which is a bit below my recent average - I think the transition back to work schedule is affecting me. Sunday was active recovery with a long walk.

Budget management was excellent at 53.8 SAR/day - I'm getting better at finding good protein sources within my budget. The meal prep on Tuesday really paid off. I'm experiencing very mild DOMS in my glutes and hamstrings, which tells me I'm working at the right intensity. Overall, a solid start to the year. I feel like I'm maintaining momentum from December."
P24,2026-W02,26.3,18.2,51.3,1680,6.7,"Week 2 complete! Overall a solid week with good consistency. Started strong Monday with W25 - felt energized and my lower back tightness from last week had resolved. Tuesday's diet adherence was excellent, stayed within budget. Wednesday's W21 session was challenging but manageable, though I noticed some fatigue creeping in mid-week. Thursday I had a small slip with an unplanned snack at work (about 150 extra calories) but caught myself before it became a bigger issue. Friday's W25 workout felt strong again, really pushed through the leg work. Saturday's W21 was modified slightly - reduced some jump variations due to knee sensitivity, probably from the accumulated volume this week. Sunday was good for recovery and meal prep. Sleep averaged around 6.7 hours, slightly down from last week due to a couple of restless nights (Wednesday and Thursday). Budget management was excellent at 54.2 SAR/day average. The diet target of 450 kcal seems quite low - I'm interpreting this as a deficit target or snack allowance, since my total intake was around 1650-1700 kcal/day to maintain energy for workouts. Overall adherence around 74% this week - slightly lower than my 76% propensity due to the Thursday slip and Saturday workout modifications. Body feels good, noticing better endurance in cardio portions. Minor muscle soreness in quads and shoulders mid-week, but nothing limiting. Ready for week 3!"
P24,2026-W03,26.1,18.3,51,1867,6.5,"Week 3 (Jan 12-18) complete! This was a challenging week but I'm proud of how I navigated it. Started strong Monday with W25 - felt powerful and energized. Tuesday's W21 session was solid despite some lingering knee awareness from last week's Saturday workout. I modified a few high-impact moves but kept intensity up with resistance bands.

Wednesday hit me hard - work stress ramped up with quarter-end reporting, and I only managed 6.2 hours of sleep. Felt it during Thursday's W25 workout; my form wasn't as crisp and I took longer rest periods between circuits. Friday's W21 was better after prioritizing an earlier bedtime Thursday night.

Diet adherence dropped to about 71% this week. Had two unplanned snacking episodes - Wednesday evening (about 200 kcal of mixed nuts, stress eating while finishing reports) and Saturday afternoon (180 kcal, social gathering with colleagues). My meal prep Sunday helped keep most days on track, but the emotional eating is something I need to watch.

Sleep averaged 6.5 hours, down from 6.7 last week. The Wednesday/Thursday restless pattern continued, and I added a rough Saturday night (only 6 hours). I'm noticing this cumulative fatigue affecting my recovery and mood. Need to prioritize wind-down routines.

Budget was 54.8 SAR/day - still excellent control. Bought ingredients in bulk and stuck to my shopping list despite temptation at the market.

Physically, my knee feels about 90% - much better than last week. No modifications needed after Tuesday. However, I'm experiencing some hip flexor tightness on my right side, probably from compensating during modified movements. Added extra stretching post-workout. Shoulders and core feel stronger; I'm noticing better stability during planks and push variations.

Weight fluctuated throughout the week but overall trending slightly down. Energy levels were variable - great Monday/Tuesday, dipped Wednesday/Thursday, recovered Friday. The stress-sleep-performance connection is really clear to me now.

For next week: Focus on sleep hygiene (7-hour target), prepare stress-management snacks (cut veggies, not nuts), and continue the hip flexor stretching routine. Feeling capable and committed despite the challenges."
P24,2026-W04,26,18.35,51.1,1985,6.3,"Week 4 was challenging but ultimately productive. Monday started strong with W25 workout completed at moderate intensity - my hip flexor tightness from last week was still present but manageable with extra warm-up. Diet adherence was good at breakfast and lunch, but I succumbed to stress-eating in the evening after a difficult work meeting (chocolate biscuits, approximately 300 extra kcal). Tuesday was a rest day where I focused on meal prep, which helped tremendously for the rest of the week. Sleep was poor (5.5 hours) due to work anxiety.

Wednesday's W21 workout felt surprisingly good despite the sleep debt - I think the meal prep motivation carried over. I managed to hit my macros almost perfectly. Thursday I felt the cumulative fatigue setting in; I was dragging all day and had another stress-eating incident with office snacks (chips and dates, ~250 extra kcal). Friday's W25 session was tough - I had to reduce weights by about 10% on lower body exercises due to hip flexor discomfort, but I completed the full workout. My sleep improved slightly to 6.5 hours.

The weekend was mixed. Saturday's W21 workout was excellent - best performance of the week, likely due to better sleep (7 hours Friday night) and lower stress. However, Saturday evening I attended a family gathering and overindulged (extra rice, desserts, probably 400+ kcal over target). Sunday was a recovery day where I prioritized rest and stretching, which helped my hip flexor considerably.

Overall adherence: 4/4 workouts completed (100%), but had to modify one session. Diet adherence approximately 68% - three significant deviation incidents, all stress or social related. Budget management was excellent at 54.2 SAR/day average. Sleep averaged 6.3 hours, which is concerning and definitely impacting my recovery and willpower around food. The positive: I'm maintaining workout consistency despite fatigue and managing my hip issue proactively. The challenge: I need to address the stress-eating pattern and prioritize sleep more seriously, or I'll burn out."
P24,2026-W05,25.8,18.3,50.8,1923,6.8,"Week 5 complete, and honestly, I'm feeling the cumulative fatigue catching up with me. Started the week determined to fix my sleep situation after those critical notes from Week 4, but work stress hit hard again on Monday and Wednesday. I managed to get 7+ hours on three nights (Tuesday, Friday, Sunday) which felt amazing - I could actually feel the difference in my energy levels those days. The workouts went well overall - completed all 4 sessions as planned with W25 and W21 alternating. Hip flexor is still tight on the right but manageable with the extended warm-ups I've been doing. 

Diet adherence was better than last week at around 74%, but I had two stress-eating incidents (Monday evening after a brutal work deadline, and Thursday when I got some unexpected bad news). Both times I went for comfort foods - Monday was about 400 extra kcal in crackers and cheese, Thursday was closer to 350 in chocolate and nuts. I caught myself earlier than previous weeks though, which feels like progress. Saturday I had a social lunch that I'd pre-planned for, kept it reasonable at about 200 kcal over target.

The positive: I hit all my workouts, my hip is improving, I'm getting better at recognizing my stress patterns, and I actually prioritized sleep on half the nights. The concerning: I'm still averaging only 6.8 hours of sleep (better than 6.3 but not the 7+ I need), the stress-eating is persistent even if slightly better managed, and I'm noticing some fatigue in my afternoon energy levels mid-week. My weight dropped slightly which is fine, but I want to make sure I'm not losing muscle mass due to the sleep deficit and stress.

Budget was excellent again at 53.8 SAR/day - my meal prep skills are really paying off. I'm cooking in batches on Sunday and Wednesday which saves both money and decision fatigue during the week. For Week 6, I really need to implement those meditation techniques before bed and maybe try a deload week if the fatigue doesn't improve. The body is willing but the recovery just isn't quite there yet."
P24,2026-W06,25.4,18.4,50.5,1842,7,"Week 6 was a mixed bag - started strong with good momentum from last week, but mid-week fatigue hit harder than expected. Managed 3 out of 4 planned workouts (75% adherence), which I'm honestly okay with given how my body felt Thursday. The hip flexor is definitely better with the extended warm-ups, barely noticed it during workouts. Sleep was slightly better at 7.0 hours average - I actually implemented that pre-bed meditation suggestion three nights and it helped me fall asleep faster, though I still woke up around 3am a couple times worrying about work deadlines.

Diet adherence was around 71% - had one significant stress-eating episode Wednesday night (about 600 kcal of dark chocolate and nuts after a frustrating work call), and went over budget Saturday at a family gathering (couldn't refuse my sister's cooking, added maybe 300 kcal). But I caught myself earlier on two other occasions and did some breathing exercises instead, which felt like a win. Budget stayed tight at 54.2 SAR/day.

Energy levels were definitely better on the days I got 7+ hours sleep - felt strong Monday and Friday workouts. The deload consideration is smart; I could feel cumulative fatigue in my legs by Thursday, so I took that rest day seriously instead of pushing through. Body feels slightly leaner around my waist, though the scale hasn't moved dramatically. Overall, I'm learning to listen to my body better and not beat myself up when I need rest. The consistency is building even if it's not perfect."
P24,2026-W07,25.1,18.5,50.3,1890,7,"Week 7 felt like a reset week, which my body desperately needed. I approached this week with the mindset of listening to my fatigue signals rather than pushing through. Monday started strong - completed W25 with good energy and the hip flexor felt almost normal. Sleep Sunday night was solid at 7.3 hours with my meditation routine. Tuesday's W21 workout went well, though I noticed some lingering heaviness in my quads from Monday.

Wednesday was interesting - I intentionally reduced workout intensity by about 15% during W25, cutting some sets short and using lighter weights on squats. This felt like the right call; I finished energized rather than depleted. My pre-bed meditation helped me get 7.2 hours of sleep that night. Thursday's W21 session was challenging mentally - I debated skipping it entirely as my legs felt fatigued, but I modified exercises (replaced jumping movements with step variations, reduced weight on lunges by 20%) and completed it at about 80% intensity.

Friday I took as an active rest day instead of pushing for a 5th workout. Went for a 25-minute walk and did some gentle stretching. This decision felt empowering rather than like a failure. Weekend sleep dipped a bit - Saturday night only got 6.4 hours due to neighborhood noise, and Sunday was 6.8 hours.

Diet adherence was around 73% this week. I had one evening (Thursday) where work stress triggered emotional eating - about 450 extra calories of nuts and dates. Saturday's family gathering added roughly 250 calories over target, but I made conscious choices and didn't feel guilty about it. The other days I stayed pretty close to my 1833 kcal target, averaging around 1890 kcal daily.

Budget came in at 54.8 SAR/day - slightly under target which felt good. I'm getting better at meal planning and using leftovers efficiently. My cooking skills are definitely improving; I made a really nice spiced chicken and vegetable sheet pan dinner that lasted two meals.

Physically, I feel less chronically fatigued than last week. The intentional intensity reduction and that Friday rest day made a real difference. My hip flexor is about 90% back to normal - only minor tightness during deep lunges. Energy levels were more stable this week, probably due to better sleep (averaging 7.0 hours) and not constantly pushing to my limit.

The biggest win this week was mental: I'm becoming more comfortable with modifying workouts and taking rest when needed, rather than viewing it as weakness. The stress-eating episode Thursday was disappointing but I recovered quickly rather than spiraling. I used breathing exercises successfully twice this week when I felt the urge to stress-eat.

Body composition changes are subtle but I think positive - my jeans fit slightly better in the waist, and I feel a bit more defined in my shoulders and arms. Weight is stable which is fine for my general fitness goals.

Looking ahead, I think I've found a sustainable rhythm: 4 workouts per week with flexibility to modify intensity based on fatigue signals, continued focus on sleep hygiene and meditation, and grace for myself around occasional diet deviations. This feels maintainable long-term, which is what I need at this stage of life."
P24,2026-W08,24.7,18.7,50.1,1842,7.1,"Week 8 felt like a consolidation week where everything I've been working on started clicking together. The flexible intensity approach from last week became second nature - I modified Wednesday's workout by about 10% when my legs felt heavy, and didn't spiral into guilt about it. Thursday's session was actually one of my strongest this week, which validated that listening to my body pays off.

Diet adherence was solid at 78% - slightly better than last week. I had one moderate overage on Saturday (family dinner, approximately 300 kcal over) and one smaller deviation on Tuesday evening when work stress hit (about 200 kcal of dark chocolate and nuts, but I caught myself early). The five other days I stayed within 50-100 kcal of target, which feels sustainable. I'm noticing I'm less fixated on perfection and more focused on the overall pattern.

Sleep averaged 7.1 hours, which I'm really pleased with. The meditation practice is now 4 nights this week - I can feel the difference in sleep quality on those nights. Even when I only got 6.5 hours on Monday and Friday due to early meetings, I felt more rested than I used to on 7 hours without meditation.

The hip flexor is fully resolved - no restrictions at all during lunges or high knees. My energy levels have been consistently good, especially mid-week. I'm noticing visible changes now: my shoulders have more definition, and my pants fit differently around the waist. The scale isn't moving dramatically, but my body is clearly recomposing.

Stress management tools are becoming automatic. I used the breathing technique three times this week when I felt the urge to stress-eat, and it worked twice. The one time it didn't (Tuesday), I still managed the portion consciously rather than binge-eating. That's progress.

Budget was 54.2 SAR/day - comfortably under target. I'm getting efficient at meal prep and finding good protein sources within budget.

The biggest win this week: I'm starting to trust the process. I'm not panicking about small deviations, I'm not pushing through pain, and I'm seeing results anyway. This feels sustainable for the first time in years."
P24,2026-W09,24.3,18.9,49.8,1847,7.2,"Week 9 complete and I'm honestly amazed at how sustainable this has become. Started the week energized from last week's progress, and that momentum carried through most days. Monday's W25 upper body workout felt strong - added 2kg to dumbbell rows and maintained form throughout, which felt like a real milestone. Diet adherence was solid at 81% this week, which I'm proud of considering Wednesday's work crisis that had me reaching for comfort snacks (managed to keep it to a 250 kcal overage with mindful portions rather than a full spiral). 

Tuesday's W21 HIIT session was tough but doable - my cardio endurance is noticeably better than two months ago. Thursday's second W25 was where I really felt the progressive overload paying off; shoulder presses at higher weight with clean form, and I could see the definition in the mirror afterward. Friday's W21 I modified slightly (about 15% intensity reduction) because my quads were genuinely fatigued, not just being lazy - I'm getting better at distinguishing between the two.

Sleep averaged 7.2 hours with meditation 5 nights this week, which definitely helped with recovery. The two nights without meditation (6.8h each) I woke up noticeably groggier. Saturday's family gathering was navigated well - I ate what I wanted but stopped when satisfied, resulting in only a 200 kcal overage rather than the 500+ I might have done months ago. Sunday was a perfect adherence day with meal prep done for the week ahead.

The mental shift is the biggest win: I'm not chasing perfection anymore, just consistent good-enough effort. My clothes fit better, I have more energy for daily activities, and I'm not obsessing over every fluctuation. Budget stayed at 54.8 SAR/day with smart bulk buying. Minor knee twinge on Thursday (old issue) but resolved with extra stretching and ice. Body composition changes are visible - waist is definitely smaller, arms more defined.
